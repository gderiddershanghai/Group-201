Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries."

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.
Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.
But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.
Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.
Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty."

Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.
Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.
On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.
In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.
In conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events. Participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people."

Building specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it's kind of encouragment to this category of people , and it reflects enormous benefit to them. Either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions. But narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn't sounds a good idea.
Athelets consider as a important part of the community but the don't cover most of it, and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it.
Sports is a public interest that doesn't include specific people in it, and it's important to all genders and all ages, so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results. In other hand , providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle.
In conclousion , according to medical facts said that's doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality, specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision.

Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.
On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.
On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.
To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone."

Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.
Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.
In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.
In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike."

In my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country.
Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.
On the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.
In conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self."

In my opinion, i think that building specialised facilities to encahnce top athletes potential is essential and its such a positive development, i also think that any sports player must have a good body and eat healthy food, because a good physique can improve movement,stamina and strength etc specially in the sports that depend alot on the body as an exmaple football, basketball, table tennis, swimming etc, and healthy food helps the athlete to achieve the physique that he wants and give him even more power and activity.
builiding specialised facilities is important because they will train them specificly on certain things in order to make them the best, also they can focus on the athletes alone they are not going to be disturbed by people, every athlete with his coach, and that place only will be for the proffessnial athletes, as an example in table tennis professional players play in their clubs because they have the best enviroment to be better, they have amazing equipment such as the table the racket etc, and they have the coaches all over the place, and they can play with the players because they are all professional athletes.
additionally those player have to be very fit, all of the top players are in extremely good shape their legs are built of metal in order to help them move quick in the table and the muscules helps with stamina if they are strong they can play more without getting tired.
So yes the facilities are very helpful and crucial to reach the top and they have to follow a specific diet from the professional coaches."

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","There is currently a material issue that while the majority of students are eager to learn business or art in university, there are only a few students who want to study science, leading to numerous negative effects on community. With respect to this matter, there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects.
It is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand. In order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon, students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena. Therefore, they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand. Another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields. When student choose subjects to study at university, they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge. Since science career does not offer high remuneration, student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead.
It is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science. One clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation. This is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation. Hence, having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation. Furthermore, the current environmental crisis, such as an increase in global temperature, would perhaps reach a point of no return. Since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects, having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly.
In conclusion, it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas, resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students. Moreover, with the rise in this problem, this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues, which are two most crucial matters for society."

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.
The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.
Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.
To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine."

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In this essay we will talk about why in so many countries students do not prefer to choose science as a subject in the universities. There are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society? This essay will suggest many reasons for this problem.
The main reason of this problem is lack of trained Math and Science teachers. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science, They will develop Science and Math phobia. Due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education.
Eventually, this will effect society in many ways. If students stopped taking science as their majors, their will be shortage of doctors. Because of that, people will suffer from many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation. According to me, Government should take firm steps to stop this from happening. There must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching.This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for Science Subjects in coming future. Otherwise, it may have negative impact on society which will not be a good sign for any country."

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.
In conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future."

In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country.

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In recent time, it is observed that the number of students enrolling for Science or Mathematics in higher education is decreasing all over the world. There are plenty of reasons that are causing this decline which will affect the society negatively. In this essay, I will discuss why the number of pupils is deacreasing who prefer science stream and what will be the impacts on a community if it continues.
The main reason of this situation is lack of trained science and mathematics teachers. STEM teachers are not able to kindle the joy of learning among students. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to pursue STEM subjects, they will develop Math or Science phobia. Subsequently, they will rather prefer other streams to complete their higher education.
Eventually, this situation will impact the scociety in many ways. Firstly, there would be scarcity of doctors all over the world which will affect health sector dramatically. Eventually, people will suffer with many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take STEM subjects in university, there will not be STEM teachers to teach future generation. According to me, government must take firm steps to avoid these situations in future. There must be some training program to keep STEM teachers up to date to enhance their teaching. This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I believe that government and teachers should take the resposibility to create the conducive environment to learn these subjects in fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for STEM subjects in recent future. Otherwise, it may have negative impacts on society which will not be a good sign for any country."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.
First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.
In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.
In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong."

I completly agree with that opinion and this essay shall demonstrate some vital reasons to support my view.
A very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant's cooperation and cognitive skills. through sociallizing with other same-aged people, the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation. For instance, some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities, in a context of teamwork, in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones.
Experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills.
In conclusion, despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters, also encountering the results of a competition, whether it was failure or winning, will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.
Firstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.
Secondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.
In conclusion, I believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills, increase their confidence and resilience, and ultimately benefit their whole life. Therefore, they should be included in the school curriculum for children."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The ability to associate at school has been a great concern. Owing to this, some assume that the optimal way to boost children's collaborative spirit is through school team sports. In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.
Initially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.
Another point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.
Finally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.
In conclusion, boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them, but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports, rather than other alternatives. Despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children, I personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect.
It is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children. A classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team’s goal. This is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility, but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team. In addition, supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members, which is one of key factors for cooperation. As a result, when young people have better communication skills, they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation.
In spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation, the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way. A common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives, which is an essential skill for collaboration. When juveniles work with other people, they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with. Therefore, they have to understand the ideas from the others’ point of view in order to reach a consensus. Furthermore, another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation. This is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge. Hence, adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations, requiring them to help and communicate with other team members. Nevertheless, I totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation."

Do you agree or disagree?","Whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion. I believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally, countries need academics as well as qualified workers.
One of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area, academic or vocational, is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals. For example, Australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as, carpenters, cooks, bar managers as well as doctors, nurses and psychologists. Essentially, this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in Canada and England too.
Another point to be considered is the increase in the people's needs due to the population growth, which, therefore, affects the need for more experts in all sectors. This includes professional from different fields, such as science, construction and even thinkers. If people is encouraged to study more in one field than others, this might be detrimental to societies, leaving one sector significantly more affected. Eventually, countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career.
In conclusion, I support the idea of encouraging both, university and vocational studies. Many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers. Besides, as the population is rapidly increasing, the need for experts in multiples areas is increasing too, so promoting both is the only way to maintain a balance."

I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.
Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.
Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.
In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area."

Do you agree or disagree?","In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.
Due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.
On the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.
In my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.
In conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees."

Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.
In conclusion, I think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology, and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training, but the misunderstanding of job between some people."

In my opinion critical sports should be stopped because it not only dangerous but harmful for others as it attracts youngesters.
Firstly, the sports activities which are risky, should be banned by the government as, they are the only ones who can actually stop this life taking so called adventure and put a full stop. Infact, people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety, for instance, road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround, another example is Death's well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die.
Secondly, everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste, however, safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind. while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed.
As a result, these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones. so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary.
In conculsion, the risky sports activities should banned and government should only allow the events with keeping the risk in mind and the after effects of the activity that what influence will it have on people of diiferent age criteria."

Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports.
On the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation.
On the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community.
Finally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion","This is true that some people are sure that civil servants should avoid harmful sport activites, but other part of sosiety thinks that individuals should have freedom to choice any sport that they like. I am in two minds on this, but probably governments should take care of their citizens and be responsible for human lives.
Firstly, extrem sports are very popular above young generation in all over the world and these kinds of activity are the huge part of pastime for thousands people. Risk's lovers spend planty of time and enormous amount of money to feel freadom and to try themselfs as a brave and strong persons. For instance, in my country such sports as rock jumping, mountain cyicling and BMX are very popular. And even if these activites are dangerous, young men and women are keen on it, and they are against the governments who wants to ban this sports.
On the other hand, adult people always want to protect younger ones. To my point of thinking protection is significant habbit of human beings that we need to respect. However, governments, who try to ban dangerous sports, need to be more flexible, and not only say no for harmful sports, but involve young generation in activites that are not so risky. I also belive that media attention can make seance about all cons of extrem choice, becouse information about number of death between exrem sportmens can be helpful.
Summing up, the buning dangerous sports topic is rather complecation and importaint issue. I suppose that, the sosiety need recive more information about harmful sports, while governments have to be more responsible in building anouth common sport facilities."

Some people argue that more growth in economics won't provide additional satisfaction to its citizens. I partially agree with this viewpoint that any additional economical growth will have a diminishing returns in developed country. However money is still the driving force to well-beings.
The statisfaction level of the citizens in developed country is driven by many factors. Economical stability is of course a very important one to consider. However, there are other factors such as health care systems, education systems, and enviormental protections. These are also equally important to the financial stability of one country. Degree of satisfaction for citizens should be measured in many aspects.
On the other hand, economic wealth is the main fundemental to reach beyond just putting food on the tables. For government, any additional wealth can be utlized to slove potential social problems. For examble, there is always money needed to funding hospitals for better health care. Secondly, additioanl wealth can also be used for protection of the country against terriosts attack and war prevention. The military force needs ongoing funding to promote stability and order in the world for developed country. Thirdly, more wealth can be used to develop new technology to better our daily lives. If we need a new breakthrough in high tech industry, government needs more financial support to help scientists doing reseach and development.
In conclusion, I believe the satisfaction of citizens in developed country can always be better off with additional wealth."

In my opinion, I consider that the countries must always have plans to increase their income whether they were rich or not.
Another point to consider, growing the country economic may help in future or to be saved to emergency situations.
Moreover, expansion of economics income could not make the people satisfied but in other hand may be used in increase the luxury life.

Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.
Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.
Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.
To conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. Meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve."

First of all, the public social services will be improved.This is due tho the reason that the government is not limited to its economic resources.For example when the government want to construct new road of any distance kilometers,it will construct within a given period of time
Another reason is based on how people are willing to pay taxes. In any developed country, people are likely to pay taxes willingly.Forexample when a company generate its revenue for more than 100%, its capable to pay the taxes and pay its employee high salary and sweet bonus.This leads to satification of citizens.
Addition to that, is ability for the high and middle economy class citizens to provide support or donations to poor or low level economy class citizens.This is due to the fact that rich people are often likely to provide to bread to the poor one.
In conclution, its obvious the fact that addition economy in the developed country is not the only factor to make its people satisfiable.There are number of factor including political stability, good government leadership but few to mention.However in my opinion i believe additional economy in economically giant country dramatically contribute to satification of majority of citizens."

From my point of view, I completely disagree this opinion.
Firstly, there still has a gap between rich and poor people in the reach country. As the economic situation of a country is getting better and better, it is true that most of the people would like to believe that all the residents will live a happy ever life. But still, there must be some people struggle to manage their life. Take China as an example, the GDP of China saw a dramatic increase in the recent years, people in the mega cities or the first level cities like Beijing and Shanghai do not worry about their food anymore, and can enjoy their high quality life. However, there still has some poor citizens who live in the small city and trying their best to feed their children. These poor people may not earn enough salaries or lost their job, thus, any addiction increase in economic wealth may be an opportunity for them, which can makes them feel satisfied enough.
Secondly, the growth in economic will make residents richer than before. People are living in the material world, no one will refuse the economic wealth to make their life better. A rich country means most of the residents in this country is middle or above middle class, an increase in the economic wealth means they can get a better house, send their children to a better school, spend more time on leisure activity instead of working, for all these benefits that the economic growth bring to them, they would fell satisfied.
In conclusion, I believe that in the rich country, people are still satisfied the increase in economic wealth, as this can reduce the gap between rich and poor people, and allow citizens to enjoy their life better."

In terms of problems, the most population in rich country, They not feel to under them which income in their country. The main reason given to support this claim is that they usually comfortable life and request additional, subsequently they not engurage to support the limit people income. To illustrate, In Japan the population most of them is selfish, They not donate or help the limit people income. In other words the rich countries when additional increase in economy is become negative things.
However, The some rich countries is support young people and donate to poor countries. Firstly, UK is support its population in terms of sports. In other words they built several sport facilities to support official clubs and public people. For instance, Football fields in public places, which the more people saves their health. Secondly, In France it has some factories for make the cars, And bring students from the cars college to the factories because take experience before graduation. Also, some of the young people they has unique hobby, subsequently rich country it can spent money to support talent young.

Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"An increasing number of individuals are taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery in order to achieve a better appearance. I strongly believe that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery are the reasons for the above. Likewise, I think that it is a negative development for our society.
To begin with, it is very well known that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery affect the behaviour of the citizens. Mass media advertising is promoting an uncommon archetype among the population. Plenty of men and women feel that they do not have sex appeal due to the fact that their bodies are different to those shown on television. Moreover, cosmetic surgery costs are more affordable nowadays than before. Hence, several women receive cosmetic surgery as a birthday gift.
Additionally, I strongly believe that taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery reflects a negative development in our communities for the reason that it reveals that plenty of people have mental health issues. For instance, low self-esteem has been increasing among the young population during the last years. Besides that, cosmetic surgery centres the attention on beauty instead of other more important values, such as honesty, creativity and charity. For example, there are fewer Non-Governmental Organizations such as Green Peace at the present moment than in the past.
To conclude, harmful mass media advertising and lower costs of cosmetic surgery translate into a negative development in our communities due to mental health issues and citizens spending money on nonsense. I would strongly recommend that authorities create laws to regulate mass media advertising."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. Considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that there is a positive development.
It is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. An obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. This is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients’ nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. Another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. When people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.
Contemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. A common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. When people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. Another classic example is building more networking. This is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people’s attention. As a result, more and more people might want to know them.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people’s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. This is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people’s attention to them, which could grow their connections."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"People have always desired to improve their external features. However, while the time went by, methods of changing appearance for the better have significantly changed. Today, more and more people decide to improve the way they look via cosmetic surgery. In the following essay I'm going to speculate on the topic and explain some possible reasons of this trend.
Obviously, there are plenty of reasons of this tendancy. To start with, operation is an easy way of improving your appearance. People are attracted by this method because they don't need to go to the gym or control their diet anymore. The only thing they need is to call a special doctor and pay money. In addition, it's obvious that every trend is caused by the changes of standarts in society. Nowadays, the number of people who are sure that unnatural beauty is attractive is growing every day. Affected by the opinion of their friends or family members more and more women decide to use surgery in order to change face or other part of the body.
Personally, I strongly believe that this bandwagon both worsens the way people look harms health as well. I'm convinced that nothing can surpass natural beauty; meanwhile, every medical operation goes against people's organism and spills what was created by the universe. For example, some famous artists who have used cosmetic surgery in order to stay young are now looking like dolls. What's more, sometimes chemicals which are used during such operations can cause awful consequences for not only people's appearance, but for their health as well. I can still remember a story of one boy who wanted to swell his muscles in a shorter way by using some medecine but, as a result, he appeard in a hospital with serious blood illness due to inappropriate choice and careless usage.
Taking everything into account, it's my firm conviction that even though cosmetic surgery seems to be a proper way of improving appearance, it is very overrated. On the contrary, such operations do not only worsen the way people look , but can be extremely dangeraus for their organism as well, while natural beauty is here to stay forever."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look?

What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.
In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.
The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.
There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.
To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body."

Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.
One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.
On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.
In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.
In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship."

Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"What children like to do in free time ? All children have diffrent ideas and preferences. So that many parenets think what should they provide and organize for their kids or not.
Children have free mind. Sometimes that make out of control their behaviours. In this modern world, we have so manyv tools to connect to out side of their world, for example internet, social network. If parents are not organised to kids's freet time, children have so many chance to take those tools. Not all internet stuffs are bad, but also there are lots of appropriate contents for kids around. Kids should be protected and orverviewed by parents or caregivers whatever they are doing. Moreover, if they are not controlled their free time by parents, kids never have limit of spending time for something they are into it. Time management is important for kids, free time shouldn't be until late night.
On the other hand, what will be happned if parents don't organised their free time.
Kids are using their imagination or ideas in their free time to play. There is no organising stuff from parents, so that they might try to find what they need and want to do. Therefore, they develop their indepndence and social skills.
In my opinion, I think kids should be organised their free time by parents. Compared with both side of effect, I personally choose kids's safety rather than developping independence. Independence and social skills can develop in other situation also. Howevere, kids""s safety cant choose"

Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Apart from education, leisure is an essential part that helps children to discover their interests and develop both physical and mental abilities. While many agree that parents are responsible for managing their children's free time, the others argue that the kids themselves should be entitled to make their own decisions. As a grown up, I personally believe that the kids should be allowed to select activities based on their preferences within the scope provided by the parents, as per the following reasons.
To begin with, no one likes to be forced. After long days of either tiresome work or study, everyone wants to enjoy their time afterwards. This also applies to the students, which in many cultures, are put into after school classes to spend more time tutoring in order to catch up with the academic standards. Although some can endure this intense lifestyle, most of the time, these schedules usually cause the kids to be overworked and stressed. Therefore, it is important to spare some times for the children to manage their own activities. Nevertheless, unlike adults who are financially independent, the kids can be subjected to many limitations.
Despite being able to participate in many activities, the underages must be legally supervised by several reasons, one of them being decision-making abilitiy. Parents can play a very important part in disapproving activities that are inappropriate for the kids. For example, if not accompanied or consulted, children can end up meeting with strangers or playing dangerous extreme sports. Furthermore, most of the time, the underages usually rely on their parents' earnings, which lead back to them approving the recreational budgets.
All in all, it is necessary to allow the kids to have autonomy over their free time as it allows them to develop sense of responsibility along with discovering their interests. However, these decisions must be reviewed and approved by the parents to ensure the budget added and security of the children themselves."

Freedom for childrens is going to the park and play football with other friends, or going to the cinema, but they cannot do everything without parents help.
Cristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid to be the number one on football, I don't think this is the right way, because he's put so much pressure on him, he should let him choose his life.
Also depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.
Children's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...
Parents always protect kids and they don't allow them see bad things but my opinion is: make them ready for the life, even if one thing is uncomfortable or unpleasant let them see, probably the shock will be very high but slowly it will get lighter, strong moments make strong people, weak moments make weak people...
At the end of this topic I can confirm that the best experiences of my life has been made by myself, without parents, without help, just with my friends and my curiosity, parents must follow us until the end of our childhood but after that, we have to start work with our feet."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"Young people in some countries are encouraged to take one gap year to work or travel abroad between their high school and university studies. This essay will discuss both of the benefits and drawbacks of the experiences of one year adventure in foreign countries for young people.
To start with, there are several advantages to this adventure abroad. Firstly, young people can meet people from different cultures, beliefs, and ages, and broaden their thoughts and experiences of the world. For instance, they may have cultural shock and reflect their own views and values about life and the world. In this way, they may become more open-minded and tolerant of different people and cultures. Secondly, they can make friends with people in other countries and broaden their social networks. This can become long-term friendships and they can gain a global perspective of the world. This is not only beneficial for themselves, but it can also benefit their societies and countries in long run as well.
However, there are also potential drawbacks to this journey. First and foremost, they can encounter some dangerous situations, such as being scammed, robbed, and even physically harmed. Numerous reports in the media about unfortunate cases that young people in foreign countries being kidnapped, forced to consume or sell drugs, and even being killed. It could be dangerous for them if they meet local gangster bands and have no one to rescue them. Therefore, it is essential that young people take precautions to keep their safety while abroad.
To sum up, although there are potential risks in the one-year journey, the advantages of broadening their horizons of thoughts, becoming open-minded, and experiences of forming new friendships with people in other countries could outweigh the disadvantages if the young people take measures for their safety while abroad."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"In other nations, after graduation in high school, youth are encouraged to go overseas for travel or to find a job for a period of one year prior to enrollment in universities for continuing studies. Some people believed that these have an effect on young people. The advantages on young people when working or traveling before entering college are saving money and making funds which can be used for matriculation, and they can have enough time for mental break which foster mental health that will help them more prepared individual as student. While the disadvantages are waste of money when traveling and delayed finishing studies when working.
Moreover, when deciding to take an educational break for travel or work between finishing high school and entering in college has advantages. First would be making funds for enrollment fees and saving money for allowance. Young people can have the opportunity to support themselves in their studies instead of asking financial support from parents. By this way, they become more independent because they can provide their daily necessities. Second would be achieving healthy mental health through traveling abroad. For some students, high school is stressful just like college especially when they are too serious in studying. Going abroad for a vacation might help to destress the students at the same time giving self a time for relaxation which is essential to the mind and body.
However, this decision also brings disadvantages to young people like wasting of money or savings from parents when traveling abroad. Instead of saving this money for college, it is used for booking a trip, hotel accommodation, and other recreational activities. Another would be waste of time, because instead of finishing studies on time in a university, students might be delayed in their graduation because of a year spent in vacation. As a consequence, timeline in studying and getting a degree is longer than usual."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"The gap year is an issue that has sparked debate. It is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. From a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.
On the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. Young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. There are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness. In order to have a gap year, they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future. Nowadays, more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform. Besides, their decision will help them understand themselves, and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long-day traveling.
On the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. The young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. On some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. Thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.
To sum up, the gap year will bring more experiences for young people. It is my belief that the advantages outweigh the others."

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.
It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.
It is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.
In spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English."

Human with their awareness, cognition reveal that the advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. I agree with this statement. Firstly, English as a primary invention for interactions and social communicating have been playing an important role for the innovative development of the society, to identify, some countries in the world are colonized by the United Kingdom became more revolutional and now developed, as a consequence, the culture of learning the international language which is English is spreaded through nations and generations of migrating from countries to countries, this create a better understanding and initialize investments between the developed and the undeveloped ones through an international language. Moreover, English is a both logical and basic international language, throughout years of developing, English with its' improvements in meanings and pronunciations, is recognized as a familiarity to everyone, it is gradually becoming easier and not too complicated for people to learn, as a result, English can expedite the problem of language barrier and easily becomes a global language. Furthermore, English as an international language with its' ease and uncomplicated structures can get people the opportunity to get themselves their employment, since English is already known as a popularity in ways of interacting with languages, verbal communication, if English can be spreaded, it can cure the problems of unemployment and a lack of work force. In summarize, English is an amazing language, with its' growth, we can hope for a better perspective, and for a better communication."

The question is, is this viral of English has a negative view or not? In this essay I will discuss and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of advantages there is many. Firstly, this spread of English language wil make the communication easier more than before . In other words, travelling to a new country that you are not speak there language is not a big problem these days because most of people are speaking English or at least know the main essential questions and there answers .To illustrate, If you are travelling to Italy you don't have to learn Italian language your English will be enough. Secondly, some languages are hard to learn like Chinese and Turkish, so using the English as a united language is much easier than using other language.
Moreover the massive spread to English may had some disadvantages the main given reason I support this claim is that the consist of using English language in countries will make some other languages disappear. To illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with English in work and school and all daily conversations. On other hand, some countries like Turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with Turkish.
In conclusion, although this spread of English may diminish other languages, but still having English language is important. That's why I believe that using English is essential especially if you are working with international companies and collegues."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.
English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.
In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.
In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Since the middle of the 19th century, English is recognized as the most important language and world common language. There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.
To go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.
Fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.
In contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, ""Icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.
Finally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes. Tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Since the middle of the 19th century, English is recognized as the most important language and world common language. There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.
To go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.
Fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.
In contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, ""Icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.
Finally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes. Tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.
In conclusion, English will continuously spread worldwide."

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.
I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.
I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again."

In some Southeast Asia countries such as Thailand and Columbia, bugs like spiders and grasshoppers are common protein sources for the general public. To solve the food shortage in the growing population around the world, there is a voice to consume insect-based products instead of traditional meats. Meat industries have a negative reputation for being eco-unfriendly. Also, not all the family can afford to have meat. So is insect-based food a solution to the population booming era?
First of all, let us look into what insects take part in the ecosystem, Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. It means that many animals consume bugs as their main diet. One of the concerns of humans eating insects for food is whether the collection of insects will affect the environment. Over-collecting insects may endanger some species which rely on insects to survive. Farming insects may be an idea to grow insects for food but the impact on the farming environment is still under observation.
Food safety is another concern of eating insects. There are a few thousand kinds of insects, some of which are known as poison. Although most of the edible insects do not contain poison, identifying which kinds of insects are safe to eat will be an issue.
Nevertheless, eating insects can be an option. There are some countries that are mature in having insects. Whichever sources of the insects are safe and eco-friendly, insects can be a subsidy of proteins when lacking meat sources. However, there is still a long road for insects to become the main source of food in this state."

One of the solution being brought into spotlight is consuming insects. While some people believe that this can be a proper path to end the world's hunger, others argue that it will further lead new problems.
To begin with, there are various aspects of advantages in using bugs as protein substitutes. Bugs are not only available in all continents but the majority of them have short life cycles. If farms shift to grow insects rather than the currently available lifestock, less costs and investments will be needed as they only need weeks to mature while other lifestocks require months or even years. Then, what prevent the humanity to covert to insectivore?
As well as tremendous benefits, the idea of consuming athropods can raise numbers of concerns. Introduction of new insect species and increase of their populations can extremely affect native ecosystem. To elaborate this, alien species introduced from one area to another can be dangerously invasive and can ultimately result in extinction of native species. One example is gold fish which were released into lakes can multiply their populations in short period and over the years, they doubled in size and eradicated their counterparts in original food chain. Therefore, arthropods which are much smaller and aglier can effortlessly escape farms and survive in extreme environment will cause disasters to the nature and crops in the farming areas.
All in all, consumption of insects can be humanity's new opportunity to survive as it requires less resources and provides abundant produces. Nevertheless, this change in food source require more researches to ensure sanitary and nutritions as well as time for the consumers' adaption to the new concept."

As the world population continues to grow rapidly, members of society have expressed concerns over food supplies and demand. A huge percentage of the world population are experiencing starvation and nutrients deficiency. In order to solve world hunger issues, providing edible insects as an option for food could be a feasible solution.
Chicken, beef, fishes, are some of the most common food products in the current days. There are thorough and informative research on them to ensure people are consuming them consciously. On the other hand, the same couldn't be said about insects. A large group of people seem to believe that they are an unhealthy food option. This could be due to the the insect habitats, which may seem unsanitary compared to other sources of protein. Furthermore, harvesting insects may negatively affect nature. Although small, they are a significant part of the ecosystem. Making insects a food option would decrease their numbers which could create crucial changes that we are not prepared for.
However, using edible insects as a food option would help to provide a bigger and wider range of choices for the world population. As the population grows, it is only logical to also increase the food supply. Furthermore, there are countries across the globe with high willingness to try insects as a food option. If we utilize this data accordingly, we may be able to provide an additional option to countries that would like to try them.
In conclusion, people in many parts of the world are not ready to consume edible insects. In my opinion, raising awareness on reducing meat consumerism may be easier and a more feasible solution to the problem. It is evident that our societies need more research on insects as food product."

Some people in some areas are getting benefits from eating insects as a meal where insects are the worst scenario in nature.

All over the world, people in so many areas are most familiar with those insects. By using insects on their land, they are doing it with less cost and more efficiency and also they are not providing too much effort to get insects as it comes from nature so easily.
For some people, eating insects is so common and reliable but it gives a lot of bad experiences when it publishes negative reactions in the human body. some people suffer from eating insects a lot. sometimes it gives people nutrition and energy as they believe but sometimes it is just the worst scenario having or eating insects such as diarehuiya,colleriahuia, and common bacterial issues in the human body.

We need many youngers that can join us.The elderly people can not do much things,for example take a bus,go to hosiptal and even walk.Maybe they need someone next to themselves all of the time.
I think that the elderly people do not need to be managed,they need to be loved,because they are the people,they are not the anomals or some things.people need love,not manage.The looking after is not managing.

However, I am inclined to believe that the increase of elderly people will be under control. While many challenges are likely to taken place, there will be effective ways to manage this civil segment with the cooperation of both government and private sectors.
As the elderly population is expanding, the demand for nursing homes or elders’ clubs are on the increase. To meet this demand, private sectors are investing on this type of institutions and services as they foresee the lucrative profit these businesses can probably generate in the near future. Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.
Another reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.
Last but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.
In conclusion, I believe the elderly problem is likely to be handled well if there are joint effort of both private and public sectors in creating healthcare system and human resource management."

This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.
First of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.
Nevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.
To summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder."

Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.
Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.
In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework."

I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.
In regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.
By contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.
In conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only."

Do the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages?
I personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits.
Firstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.
Secondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.
Althought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives.
Overall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring."

In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.
Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.
Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.
Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy."

The benefits of economic growth include higher average incomes. Economic growth enables consumer to consume more goods and services and enjoy better standards of living.
The economic progress is an important goal for governments, because firstly, a healthy economy results in job creations, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on infrastructure and public services.
Another progress is important for a country, in my point of view, technical progress or technology in general is very important for a country, in many bases.
The technological progress refers to the discovery of new and improved methods of producing goods.
The term process technology refers to chemical processing used to refine raw materials into finished products. For example, process technology is used to refine crude oil.
Technological prosperity also lies in global purposes, so for military purposes and war technique, are important in terms of preparation and possessing advanced weapons.
And also for local and domestic or personal purposes, for example use of modern devices, and networks of the fifth generation ( 5G ).
There are many other types of important progresses, as industrial progress, architectural progress, commercial progress and civilization progress.
It all complements each other at the end. And all of them are of particular importance."

In my opinion, I believe that apart from economy, government should also consider other types of progress which also consider other types of progress which give equal importance to a nation.
first of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.
Desipte this, on the other hand,many argue that governments should also think about considering other types of progress which are as equal as economic progress. for instance, many countries are being recognized because of their education status and culture which attracts young stars to travel and study which in other terms also increase GDP. Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities. As a reason, the country's government should also focus more on other factors leading to progress.
In conclusion, I believe that government should not solely goal for economic growth but also concentrate on other factors which are equally important for a country's growth."

It is convenient living in a big cities as you could be close to work, or have variety of choices when eating out, many people choose to live in a city. However, there are people who believe that there could be some health concerns by living in big cities. This could be ture to some extent, but I do not agree compeletely with this openion.
One of the biggest health concern could come form air polutions, as big cities likely to have heavy trafics, especially in the third would coutries. However, in the developed coutries, many cities have as same amonut of trafics as suburban areas, or evern less. For example, many big cities in developed coutries charges a lot for parkings. This will encourage people to commute by public transportations. As a result, you could see less cars on the road in the cities.
There are also a health concerns coming from having less exercise. However, usually, ther are many gyms in the city. Also, many cities tend to have a big park or walking track, wher people can go for walks and jogs.
However, I agree that people living outside the cities, especialy wher surrounded by natures will have more cleaner air. Also having more space to exercise, compare to people living in cities may assist in being able to maintain their health.
Some people thinks that it is not good for people's health to live in big cities. However, environmental facts varies depending on each cities. I believe thath people can still live healthy as much as people living in a suburban areas, if the trafic is significantly heavy compare to other area of the coutries, of have an opportunities to exercise regularly."

While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.
To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.
Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.
All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life."

However, some people consider that the life in big cities is generally hazardous for the health of people. In my opinion, although big cities provide many amenities to the people but the city life is not good for a person when it comes to health.
The main reason is continuous increase in population. Metropolitan cities attract people from small towns and/or villages in search of better opportunities, good education for their children or medical facilities. This migration makes these cities overcrowded. As population increases, there will be many vehicles on roads. More traffic will lead to more air and noise pollution. Likewise, as the population increases, the demand for housing also will escalate. To fulfill the demand of housing, local government has to reduce the green space to built more buildings in the city which will lead to more pollution. Obviously, pollution causes many health issues.
Another reason is stressful and busy life in the big cities. People working in big MNC companies in the cities, have deadlines to complete their work. If they are not able to meet the deadlines, it will affect their growth in the company. People in metropolitan cities are so busy that they don't have time to take care of their health. Living in a continuous stress without taking care of the health leads to many health problems.
To conclude, the life in a big city is very stressful, busy and surrounded with a lot of pollution, which is not good for health of an individual."

However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to people’s health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individuals’ health conditions.
Undoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitants’ health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.
However, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individuals’ mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.
Furthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizens’ health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizens’ health conditions can be diminished physically.
In conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individuals’ mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine people’s health."

In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.
A row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.
On the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.
To sum up, living in megapolice can possibly extend your life, but for me the quality of this life is still doubtful."

Living in a large metropolitan can bring many challenges to one's health. When you live and work in a never-ending rat race there can be consequences to your health becasue of the continuous stress brought on by increased workload, longer working hours and very little time to rest.

In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.
The utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.
Another benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.
The third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.
In a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be."

Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.
First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.
Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work."

I had to rewrite the abstract.However, my poor English made the process difficult.Having experienced that, I strongly feel that translation software is not the best way to use language.Only when languege stepping in our mind, can we use language truly.
The one of the main usage of language is communication,meanwhile,speaking is the most effective way to communicate with each other.If we comunicate with English speaker by using the translation software, it may be ineffective and even make miskakes.So if we have oppotunities to learn a languge,we should take action.
Translation software doesn't decline the need of language learning .opposively,it is benefit for the language learning.When we come across some words unknown,using,translation software is more convient than referring to the dictionary.
In a word,the wide use of the translation software dosen't mean that we don't need to learn language.What we should do is use the software critically with the accumulation with language learning.We are the owner of the tools ,not a slaver of a tool.We should keep our independace in some fields."

Owing to limited usefulness of translation softwares in daily life, to large extent, ı agree with this statement. However, educationalists may use these programmes as supporting management systems for academical purposes.
A growing number of softwares are available on online platforms to help people for translating documents or improve their language skills. Individuals from different sociocultural or educational levels frequently utilise these open-access and easily understandable operating systems. Moreover, some teachers recommend their use to promote the learning process of primary school pupils. Last but not least, because translating a sheet by using these programmes is less time-consuming and free of charge, its use is gaining popularity among young individuals with regard to academic communication and correspondence.
On the other hand, the utility of these file management systems are questioned by some experts in the field of philology. Some linguistic scientists stated that translation supporting systems distracts children’s motivation and eagerness to learn the grammatical rules of a language. Additionally, while these operating tools have benefits in terms of easening the written communication, it has no practical advantage or use in verbal interaction. From my point of view, softwares should not be introduced to children before learning basics of a language and gaining an intermedicate level of spoken and written vocabulary.
In conclusion, although translation softwares have limited benefits such as costeffectivity and usability, it should be restricted as a complementary tool for people with a significant background and knowledge of a language, and the advantages of learning a language including practicality in face to face communication clearly outweighs."

However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.
First of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.
In fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.
Furthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.
One of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, ""Saudade"" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.
Besides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.
Lastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.
To illustrate this, when talking to the AI ""Siri"" on the iPhone or ""Alexa"" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.
In conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated."

I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
This is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
Coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
Later on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
In conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill."

Some argue that routine behavior is adequate for spending their life, by others do not agree with this thought. This essay will attempt to provide a brief analysis.
First of all, it is a fact that people feel comfortable to being and doing things that they being familiar with, by fixing routine in every day we can make our life certain and manageable. For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field. This helps people to reduce the risk of facing things we not prefer.
However, all of the creatures has to develop and adapt to an environment to survive in this crucial world and not even human, this important for us to leave our comfort zone in some situation. Encouraging new challenges in life could give us to develop and explore new skills or new ways of thought. From my experience, I recently tried to play a new sport that I never thought I will in love with, which is golf. It is the kind of sport I never play in my life, I am not only got a new way of enjoyment of this sport, but also bring me to know a ton of new quality friends I got from the golf society. This event can lift my life quality to another level I did not expected before.
In summary, I would say that the advantage of doing new things outweigh the disadvantage of its. Sometimes we have to take a risk to walk in the alternative way, maybe we could get new goolife we could never imagine for"

Some people think, that is it important to change our daily life. Conversely, other thinks that does not matter at all and, do not want to change. In my point of view, I think it is difficult to change. However, we have a lot of environmental issues last decade, therefore, we need to change.
Learn new habits and to try new places is difficult as we get older. So, if people arrive to create a meaningful and happyness life, I think it could be counterproductive to change. For instance, if you have a good salary, a beautifull place to live and a lovely family, it is not important to search other things. Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.
On the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.
To conclude, to change is important because in our century we have big issues. But as we seen there are no explicit reason to change if there are no problem and we are happy in our life."

Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.
Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.
Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.
In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing."

First of all, when we live on same schudale for all days that mean the tommorw we know what we do. For example, the person he work on any spicalist and he know what will do next day because it is same like the week before, and he like that and feel comforte for his live.

Second of all, when the next day or next week it is not the same of this moment or before! that descraibe there is new experince or maybe new challinges will be see that front of us. To illustrate, many men or womans they likes to wake up on the morning to see what they have new for those day. And for this people they get more energy and very excited for the new morning on they lives.
In addition, I saw some persons they like when they in work want to live on same routine but on weekend they belived the change is better to got or put new information, experince, or anything that diffrent for the bast week. So, they like the routine and change.

Students of today are the proffessionals of tomorrow and thus is very important they recibe a propper education. In my opinion we should divide students based on their academic ability.
If we educate all students together regarthless of their different academic abilities we will be making a hughe mistake. Students with higher capacities will not be adressed in a propper way and it will discourage them. Smart students tend to get bored very fast and therefore special attention must be pay to them.
On the contrary, if we educate students based on their academic abilities we will not only see better results in the smarter ones, but we will also take better care of the students with more learning difficulties. By using this method the needs of the students will be adressed in a better way.
Education should have an indiviudal focus or at least in different groups, taking academic abilities degrees in account.
In my personal expirience I shared classrooms with students that had special needs and teachers educate them in different ways than the rest of as. These special students have different learning times and needed more atenttion from their teachers. On the other hand, some students were very smart with great academic abilities and some of them had some behaviour troubles becouse they got bored at class, I remmember one student named Jackson Bell who was brilliant and was sent to the school physicologist due to behaviour problems(he hit other students) and if teachers have gaived Jackson the extra attention he needed that wouldn´t happen."

According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.
People that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.
The other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the ""best"" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.
To conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers. For example, if you want to create the future class of engineers, you should divide students based on their academic ability. But if you want to educate people as humankind you should not divide the class."

The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.
On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.
On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.
In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea."

Students that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects. This will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help.
However if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there's also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades.
If students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject.
However if the students are educated together there's a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades. Morever if students are educated together there's also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities.
Overall I believe students should be divided according to their academic abilities this is because students are more likely to understand the information provided by their teachers as they are provided with additional support and students should be more mature enought to undertsand that if they do not meet specific academic requirements they should not be demotivated, they should understand how to handle the situation and show that they can be courageous enough to do even better as the students are provided with additional support."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools. Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.
Proponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet students’ needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each student’s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.
Others, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each student’s academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children’s all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.
In conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters’ gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead."

Although some people believe that homeschooling is the best teaching method for the developement of children, most people are of the opinion that it is essential for children to go to school.
The most popular of the two opinons is that it is important for children to attend school. The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.
The other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.
In conclusion, I believe that it is best for childrens developement to be taught at school, rather than parents teaching their children at home. I hold this opinion since school attendance can enhance childrens social skills and their ability to navigate the world around them."

While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.
On the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.
On the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.
In conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home"

I think that sending children to school give them a great advantage not only in their academics but also in their development and social skills.
Having children at home and be their teacher is not easy. Although, it may be important for their development. A good side of home schooling, is the chance to be more connected with your own family and being able to manage your own time without having strict schedule. This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.
On the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills. They have more opportunities to create connections and interactions with other students with the same age and also it might be considered more helpful to be in the same situation with others, so that they can learn to help each other.
However, in my personal experiece being in a class with a lot of students can be hard. Find the ""right people"" to be with might be challenging but at the end it is satisfying, because you might also end up having friends for life and creating good memories,
In conclusion, these two different methods are both acceptable, as long as the child best interest is done, no matter if his being teached at school or at home."

However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.
Undoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.
On the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.
To sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option."

Controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. This essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.
During the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. For decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. For example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. The belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. Thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. Considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. Love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. As such, people have the right to love and get married.
,
hence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. In a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. As such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.
To sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. Thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage."

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Thanks to the modern society, people feel free to behave more naturally than before, without the necessity of hiding aspects of their personal life, such as the sexual orientation. For that reason, the number of omosexual women and men seems to increas and some people are worried about the impact that this could have on the society. In my opinion, the government should not interfere with this topic and, consequently, gay marriage should be legally allowed.
Nowadays, being a omosexual couple is difficult because the society does not recognise them the same rights of an eterosexual couple, such as the possibility to adopt children or to share goods. As human beings, gay women and men should have the same opportunities and rights of every other people. Hence, they should be allowed to legally marry and live their life as a normal one.
Furthermore, I think that gay couples do not affect the wellness of the society in any way. Indeed, even if people believe that the only possible family is the traditional one, it is not true and other kind of family does exist. Many children grow up by people of the same sex and this does not affect their education or influence their thought. For that reason, different type of family should be recognised.
Considering the above point, I think that people should have the right to choose from their own who to share their life with, without any legal restriction. In order to allow that, the governement should legalize the marriage between gay couples."

Some people firmly believe that they are bad for society, whereas others preach that people should be free to choose the person they want to be with for the rest of their life, regardless of gender. I endorse freedom of choice and following your heart and for those reasons I support the idea of gay marriages being legal and widly accepeted.
In today's world people are thought to treat everyone equally, to accept other people's desires and opinion and not to judge them based on that. Morals that did not exist in that past. Happiness should not be judged or illegal. When a person is happy he will want to give back and help others by, for example, volunteering and solving public issues and participating in charity organisations.
Furthermore, the acceptance of gay marriages has other great effects. For example, gay people biologially cannot have offspring. This has two main benefits . Firstly, world population is growing at an alarming rate and gay marriages help lower that rate of birth because of their biological nature. Secondly, if a gay couple decides that they want to have a child, they can addopt one. That is great because nowadays orphanages are a shellter for many kids who do not have a family.
In conlusion, the acceptance of gay marriages is improtant both morally, to allow individuals to embrace their true nature and desires and not oppress them, and politically because it can potentially help solve an issue that is possing a great threat to the world we live in."

I am of opinion that gay marriage should be legal and the reason will be outlined below.
To begin with, nowadays, human equality is becoming more and more important. Hence, men should have the right to marry a person with the same gender. Since this right is one of the fundamental living, governments should revise the law to reflect this type of marriage and enforce it accordingly. This is exemplified by developed countries, which pay attention to human rights, allowing a man to marry another man legally.
Furthermore, gay marriage will not be likely to cause negative effects on societies. On the other hand, this trend tends to increase countries’ economic growth. As a result of implementing the policy which promote same-sex marriage, gay couple around the world tend to be attracted by this government support, and possibly move and live in the country. To illustrate this, there is research demonstrating that the economy of Canada has been growing substantially after allowing gay marriage to be legal.
In conclusion, it seems to me that gay marriage should be legal due to the human right and the positive consequent which possibly contribute to the potential rising in countries’ economy."

This question remains quite arguable currently. A part of the population tends to have the opinion that gay marriage could affect the community in a destructive way, while the other part sees this perspective as the development of social nature, freedoms, and basic human rights. I believe that every individual person has the own will to decide for themselves who they want to marry, overall, other people are not the ones to make a decision.
First of all, it is widely recognized that conservative and religious societies have a low tolerance for gay marriage because it can destroy their core values and outlook in life. It is generally known that such people think that the legalization of gay marriage can lead to the devaluation of heterosexual couples and their marriage, which is extremely harmful to the community. For example, there is one opinion widely spread in Utah that such legalization can devalue heterosexual marriage, which will lead to an active extramarital sex life, and therefore to a wild increase in the number of abortions. So, it is clear that gay marriage can be adverse.
On the other hand, forbidding marriages that are not heterosexual equals ignoring the basic rights and freedoms of every person. Besides, the research in Utah shows that the previously mentioned fear is completely irrational and Global Health Organization declared that being homosexual is not one of the mental problems. When couples live together and love each other but can not be bounded by official documents, it can cause a lot of legal problems. For instance, when one of them is in the hospital in critical condition, the other can not make a decision about treating or even visiting a beloved one due to the fact that they are not legally related. Such conditions could lead even to fatal consequences.
In conclusion, I believe that each individual person can have their own opinion, but this should not affect other people's lives in a negative way. That`s why I think that homosexual marriages should be legalized."

with that sounding strongly controversial, with no middle grounds to meet, I might as well take a side. no. I don't think this sounds logical.
throwing your parental responisbilities on outside factors such as 'government' or 'a universal conspiracy' is merely being paranoid. the government does not benefit from creating obese children, nor do they have the leisure time for such idiotic problems. point such allegations on business companies, it sounds more believable.
whenever obesity is mentioned, my mind jumps into the bigger picture of children given allowances, of which they barely save from and continuously spend on unhealthy food. that, my dear, is the reason for obesity. lack of observation, lack of strict rules, lack of awareness. as a mother, it is important to monitor your children's diet and health. it is equally important to give them a good space to play sports in, which would greatly decrease obesity rate. assuming that the government has a hand in such trivial matters, they won't control you from looking after your children properly. that, as well as a point metioned previously: what do they benefit? spending money and effort and time on, lets say, sponsors to attract children to candy, funding children sweets, and sponsoring for attractive street food to engrave the constant need for those in a child's mind. the question is, what do they gain in return? it is foolish to fund that that doesn't give back equal benefit
so let's state it again, only a foolish government is responsible for the rise of obesity in children"

It is argued that the government should be held solely responsable for this pandemic, but I personally disagree with this statement.
The government is already taking measures to prevent this devastating issue. Firstly, it is promoting numerous campaigns against obersity at a young age showing the detrimental effects that this condition can trig in a life time with the terrific consequences. Moreover, authorities are trying to correct unhealthy habits, taxing sugar in drinks and foods and removing sweet and high fat products from public areas, such as schools and hospitals. Therefore, Government can be consider highly active on confining the increased percentage of overweight children.
Not only ministries are exstensively advertising health pattern to control weight and discourage consumption of toxic products, but they are also involving the communities in outdoor events, such as presenting the new city soccer team. So that, while promoting sports and active lifestyle, youngster can be influenced by these athletes to pursue a better physical conditions. Nevertheless, government is promptly enhancing the importance of personal training class in primary school offering schoolars the possibility of choosing gym as extra class to add to their curriculum.
To conclude, although obesity rates are rapidly raising, I do not agree that government is responsible of this outcome.

Hence, authorities are commiting to prevent this plague that could have horrible consequences on future adults."

Parents and government share the responsibility to keep children well-being. This essay will discuss reasons and examples of how both sides have responsibilities toward the children.
To begin with, Politicians should have an obligation to legislate laws that stop some food companies from selling high-calorie diets in the country. Laws toward diet companies should ban them from increasing sweeteners in candies to rise profits. In the same manner, the government has a duty to build outdoor play-ground and clubs to help parents raise healthy kids. Gardens should be grown to overcome obesity. In the UAE each block in the city has its own garden and playground. Research in the Netherlands shows a huge decline in obese children after the government renewed old playgrounds.
Parents on the other hand share a tremendously important rule. Parents should encourage their children to practice sports and substitute bad habits. Pampering the kids with a sweetened diet should be stopped. Parents should read about the effect of obesity on their kids' health. For example, simple sugar rise the glucose level rapidly causing the unexpected energetic status of the kid before bedtime. Some medical cases were seen among children related to obesity like cardio-pulmonary illnesses. If the parents were aware of these consequences they would discourage the bad habits of their children.
To sum up, government do its role in keeping the kids' wellness by building institutions and providing laws on their behalf. Also, parents should educate themselves and their children, and stop unnecessary food habits."

I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.
First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.
Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children."

Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The next essay will talk about the reasons behind the need of some people to find out about their own family history.
I believe in certain young countries as USA for example, it is completely logical to feel the need of getting to know where your roots come from.
We have to take into account that in many cases a sector of the USA population only know the nationality or the history of their grandparents, and their grandparents have very few information of their own parents, so the total history of their family is quite sort. I am spanish and lived for one year in the state of Washington with an american family. It was very surprising for me to find out how proud that family was of its european roots. It took me a while to understand their feelings. I needed to put myself into their shoes. To give a live example, my american Dad had even visited the northern part of Norway, close to the Artic Polar Circle to look for a distant cousin he had figured out he had. My american Dad was the happiest person on earth when showing the picture of his cousin and him taking a beer in Norway.
I believe there are many reasons for someone to dig into history to have a deeper knowledge of his own family. Firstly you may get a better understanding of the behaviours of your closest relatives. Also you can find the reasons behind the colour of your skin or your eyes.
To summarise, I strongly believe it is positive to get to know more about your own roots and about your distant relatives to get a better understanding of youself."

There are a lot of web-services which will help to create your own genealogical tree. Some people even hire a special agent, who help them to invistegate some information from various source of infromation.
But why do people do this? In my opinion, there are two main arguments. First of all, some country offer a citizenship for people with specific roots. For example, if you have Jewish roots, you can recieve Israel citizenship. For repatriation you need to have just a quater Jewish roots, it means, that your grandmother or grandfather must be Jewish. Sometimes it could be really difficult to provide it, but genealogical tree is a good support. Second reason why do people explore their history is just curiosity. It is really intresting to understand who were your ancestors. Maybe they were just labor or fermers, but maybe they were very famous people.
In my opinion, this is positive, that people are intresting in their history. As I see, when people are interested in their own history, they become more involved in history of their country or even in world history. In general, history is very important subject, because it could give general overview on how our society works. Also, creating family tree is good oportunity to establish relationship with distint relatives and spend excellent time with your familly.
To summarise, finding out one's family history has two main reasons. In my opinion, it is really good, that people are intresting in their famillies history."

People give different motivations as to why they do it. I suppport this activity for reasons I will further explain in this essay.
To begin with, some people want to get information about their family's history just of pure interest. It can be a great hobby for someone to invest their time and enegry into. It will help one destress and have some fun, while also enrichening his area of knowledege. In addition to having something entertaining do to in their free time, one will learn a lot about what his family has been thorugh long before he was born. This is really important because without our anscestors we would not have been born or in other words - without the past there would be no future. If one respects his family and himself enough, he should learn about who they were and where they came from.
Furthermore, learning about one's family history can be very benefitial in finding your talents. For instance, if someone finds out that in the family there once was someone who was great footballer, then this is something one should try out. Geneticaly, some people are born with specific talents, predisposing them to pursuit a ceratin career path. Being aware of your family's past can be a great hint towards your strenghts and weaknesses.
In conclusion, finding out your family's history is not only a fun hobby that you can do in your spare time, it can also assist you in finding your talents in life without having to always try out new activities."

Therefore, some people across the world try to research their own family's history in order to appreciate their efforts, this may be out of curiosity. This essay argues that one should not put out their inquisitiveness and should try to learn more about how their family really came to be.
Inquiring about one's predecessors should be persured as learning more about your own family can never be harmful, infact, doing so will only make one more appreciative towards their family and its history. Like, if it is revealed that one's family had made many sacrifices in order to preserve their bloodline and nuture it to what it is today then it would make the current family members thankful for what they have and where they stand.
Having knowledge about one's own family tree is one of the ways to make a person humble and appreciative for what they have, it also teaches a person to work hard for their own family in the future in order to provide them with a good and healthy life. Nowadays, majority of the families have cultures and customs exclusive to their own family and by studying their ancestors, the true significance of these activities can be discorvered, taught and passed down to the future generations.
To summarize, this essay believes that there really are no negatives in learning about one's own family tree, in fact, there are many positives in doing so. Asking parents to talk about their own families is a good way to build healty relationships and the knowlege gained can be passed down to future generations and the familty ehnicity can be preserved and cherished for many more decades."

Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.
Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.
As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.
Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.
However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.
In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people believe that money is the main reason why employees want to remain in the same workplace for a long time, even there could be many other reasons why to stay. It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.
The reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.
On the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.
In conclusion, I mostly agree with this averment because money is the great motivation for people, but I would also like to point up the importance of a great working group as it is another reason why to choose to stay where you are."

Some people say that this is due to money, however, I strongly oppose that money has the hugest impact on this choice in modern society. I feel this way for 2 reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.
Some augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. That is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.
Having considered all the augments above, I would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business. There must be other vital factors present such as social statius and rewarding/"

Partly, I agree that money is the most important factor which makes people stay in their job.
The reason is because we work in order to be able to purchase our daily needs. It's undeniably true that we need money to sustain our daily life. We have to use our money to pay our bills such as foods, electricity, debt and other basic needs. Furthermore, we know that the number of the number of inflation keeps increasing this year due to the unstabilty of the economic circumstance which results in the increament of goods prices. Having said that, money becomes very essential reason to stay in the company because it really helps us to afford a better life.
However, in my opinion, there is another important aspect that we should consider when we are in middle of deciding whether to stay in the company or not. The important aspect is the working environment. Aside from money, we have to make sure that we can improve our skills in the current employment. By having a positive and supportive working environment, we will be able to maximize all of our capabilities which can make us a better person professionally.
In conclusion, I agree that money becomes one of the most important factor that we should consider in choosing our job as we need money to afford a good life. On the other side, becoming a better person and feeling fulfilled by our job also requires other important aspect other than money which is a healthy working environment."

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.
Manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.
Customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.
Personally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The use of products and goods with a lot of packaging is a highly controversial topic between people today. A lot of people believe it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce packaging of goods, while others believe that it is the individuals responsibility to avoid buying products with a lot of wrapping and packaging. I personally believe that it is the individuals responsibility to cease buying products with an increased amount of packaging, since a decrease in demand from customers could prevent further production of these goods.
The people that is of the opinion that it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging, believe that these companies have a moral obligation to preserve and protect the environment. In my country it is believed that these companies should be held responsible by the government. For example in Denmark the government provides manufacturers and stores with certain environmental regulations, which also include the amount of material these facilities are allowed to use for packaging. This helps reduce environmental harm and provides more responsibility to companies to reduce packaging.
However, the majority of people believe that this problem is an individual responsibility. This opinion considers that the moral obligation falls on the individual and not the company. The people who believe that it is an individual responsibility to not buy these products, believe that a decreased demand for products that harms the environment will lead to more environmentally friendly products produced.
To summarize, both of these opinions help reduce environmental harm. However, I believe that it is the individuals responisibility to not purchase overly packaged products, since this decrease in demand would lead to less production of these goods."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.
On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.
On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.
In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Opnions are divided on whether manufacturers and supermarkets should reduce the numbers of packaging of products, or consumers should not buy over-packaging goods. From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.
On the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.
On the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.
In conclusion, even though customers can help to solve this case, I believe manufacturers and supermarkets should take the main responsibility to reduce over-packaged goods, becasue if all sellers are competiting on it, customers will have no choices."

This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, a variety of crimes and other violent news on television, in newspapers, as well as on the Internet report might have increased to a few decades ago. Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.
To begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.
On the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should
not diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.
Finally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.
In conclusion, it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers. Some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons.
Firstly, reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes. If those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public, people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes, provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences. Abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. Hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. That is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.
In addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. If people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. Because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. Finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.
In conclusion, I agree that we should show criminal activities and violent events in the media , which can largely reduce crimes. Moreover, we should also think much more about that restricting this kind of information may lead to a high rate of crimes."

Some people think it is not good to report them on television and in newspapers beacuse it can have adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, we should not restrict this information because of the following reasons.
At first, showing the violent events can decresae some serious crimes. If the public can directly get the criminal informations, which lead to a whole understanding of the criminal process, provoking them more easily to thinking critically inculding the bad effects on social and personal areas. Take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things. Thus, there wil be less crimes and other kinds of violent events happened in our society.
Secondly, restricting the news of crimes to the public may increase the rate of crimes. Take it into more detaily, If people cannot directly obtain the criminal informations, they maybe cannot analysis the the broad of law, thus easily drop into crimes. When they have to choose whether to do or not, they can not consider more details of the serious outcomes for different kinds of criminal events and they just do it. At last, leading a severe consquences which have adverse impact on both social and personal fields.
In conclusion, i agree more with this opinion that we should explose the crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers, which can stop the crimes or decrease the rate of crimes."

In my opinion, It is more beneficial to the public to know what is happening around us so I disagree with the statememt above.
Nowadays, you can access different news outlet through television or using your phone as long as you are connected to the internet. Reading or watching the news are more and more accessible to the public. By merely, clicking the link we are able to read or watch the latest news in our area.
There are a lot of crimes happening in the world, it may have a negative consequence but I think it will outweigh the information that we will learn by reading or watching the news. We will able to know what is happening in our area and how to prevent such crimes.
In our area, according to KOMO news there are a lot of thieves lurking around 12 midnight to 4 am. They are usually walking house to house to check the porch if they can steal something. Some thieves check cars if someone forgot to lock it. This gives them opportunity to steal it.
By watching the news, this will alert the public to be on the look out and prevent the thieves from stealing valuable items from us. We can also find ways to be more safe. We can install cameras with motion censors around our house that will notify us if there are people walking around our property.
In conclusion, I disagree in restricting the report on various crimes and violent news to the public through television and newspapers because"

Sometimes these news could be violents and it could be an issues for our childs. Some people argues that they should be restricted. In my point of view, it is important to protect child from these horrific images, but also we need to keep informed them about the world if we want to protect them.
First of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. Because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. For instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. Morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.
On the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. For example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. Conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. As far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.
As far, we have seen it is important to keep contact with reality, because nowadays, our world are violent and as a result, some image could be violent. They need also to be protect from mental health problems, and so we need to explain that they watch and these images."

This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. Therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. In this essay, I will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.
The mair reason why I believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. In this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. Therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. For instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.
Another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. This may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. If media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.
In conclusion, I believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. Emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. All thing considered, I strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence. This aim may be pursued by public authorities, through the promulgation of new laws and rules."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.
The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.
Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.
In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people and governments believe in reducing the carbon dioxide of cars and other vehicles is the most effective way to solve the environment problem. Although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, I believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.
Cars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.
Recently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.
Finally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. Hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems."

other vehicles.
generally, increasing the cost of gas or fuel would decrease the amount of people utilising environment detriment vehicles. Therefore, the air quality will be healthier for both animals and humans.
In my point of view, this decision will lead to several advantages such as increasing the number of people walking and considering bikes as a way to get anywhere they need. Therefore, goverments will change the current cities structure which are fundamentally depending on cars and vehicles. To transform it to a complete new walkable and more practical cities instead. So that kind of actions has benefits not only for the coming few years but also the future as a whole.
To strengthen my opinion, when gas prices are higher than the average the majority of people will consider another transportation methods that are less damaging and more environment friendly, namely metros, modern trains, bikes or even walking around. However, people also must be educated about curtain aspects when it comes to nature and how to not experience a harmful lifestyle in general, for both the nature and the human race.
to summarize, increasing the gas prices without spreading awarness among youngsters equivalently would not be a convenient action. To confirm, extreme low gas prices could lead to another consequence that is traffic which creates a suffocating atmosphere that will surely kill wild animals and people as well as the years go by."

Listening to music is very relaxing and it will help you reduce stress. One can listen to music at home or while doing outdoor activities like running or going to the gym. Listening to music after a long working day is a greate practice that will help you decrease stress. There are diferent types of music, some are belived to be more relaxing than others like classical music compare to rock and roll. Scientists have demostrated by several investigations that music helps people reduce stress, after listening to music people feel more calm and have more clear thoughts.
Some people think that music most important function is not reducing stress , instead they found it superficial and distracting. They think other activities are better at reducing stress like yoga or playing sports. Not all people feel relax by listening to music, some may find it unconfortable or unnecessary.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In most people's life, music takes a special place. No matter if one's favourite is classical, pop, rock, or rap, it can help people distract their attention from unwanted thoughts, alleviate stress, or even reduce pain. My strong belief is that music has a significant psychological effect in maintaining mental health, and some of its most vital impacts are visible on mood and stress.
Music can induce extremely strong changes in people's mental states. There are several everyday examples that highlight the tranquillizing effect of music. Many people find out merely by instinct that they tend to calm down by listening to their favourite tunes. When someone feels anxious before an important exam, a medical visit, or a long-awaited date, music can provide a couple of minutes escape from these stressful situations, on our way to the event's venue. Soft music is also frequently utilized during meditative activities, such as yoga or relaxation. Additionally, people can come across the same type of calming tunes in dental or medical settings as well. However, these are quite passive coping techniques.
On the other hand, there are more active possible mechanisms by which music can reduce stress. When dancing or working out to upbeat music, people decrease their stress levels through movement. It can be an even more efficient way to let the harmful energies behind because of a two-way effect: music tends the soul, while the movement is good for the body, reducing tension in the muscles.
In summary, based on the above-reviewed examples of how music can be helpful in stress-relief, we can see that there is two possible mechanism, a passive and an active, which can play a role in this phenomenon."

people who live in previous centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In this modern age, some believe that people’s quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.
To begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.
The standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.
In conclusion, I believe that people living in the 21st century have a better quality life than the past."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In general, music plays a vital role in our everyday work life. It is said to be the purest form of art but it is often claimed that the main purpose of music is to make people feel relaxed.
Music addresses our psychological, mental, and spiritual needs giving us relaxation. Without any doubt, it is a sure thing that there is no day when a person does not listen to music not even once and this is really helpful for them to reduce their stress after a tiring day at work and our brain produces some healthy endorphins.
This makes them mentally refreshed and also intensifies their moods. For example, I am really passionate about easygoing soul music or folk songs and listen to them with the help of several singing apps. As a result, it soothes my mind and helps to maintain a good vibe. In addition, music has proven its healing power in the medical industry to cure various diseases. Such as listening to the verses of the Quran is being used to cure many psychological disorders.
Furthermore, a variety of authors of songs write them with their emotions when they are happy or sad. People who face similar challenges or situations like in the lyrics of the song resonate with it and that they are not the only persons with the same problems. Nature sings to every single sound that is heard in our surroundings like the chirping of birds, and the sound of heavy rain, and even when a glass is broken there is some sort of music.
To conclude, I think that the most important function of music is to explain life, its beauty, meaning, and feeling. And indeed in relaxing one's mind."

While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.
On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.
On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"People tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words.
There are several reasons for this, and I believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages. The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet.
Furthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language.
I believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends.
Secondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality.
One evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading.
In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages. I believe individuals should use informal words when texting with family and friends but when it's an office or business-related work then they should use formal words in written language."

Moreover the written text is more redundant, cohesive, calm and patient. From my point of view, it comes because we erase emotions from written text which we spread sometimes without intention via voice. Not only voice influence on it, but during the writing we have a chance to revise and check our text. Moreover this fact has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, there is a huge advantage of this cartain. When we communicate through formal language and when we are more relaxed we have a chance to spread our ideas more thoroughly. For instance, I sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if I write to him or her.
On the other hand, there is a disadvantage, that when we switch on to the speech from writing other people will be surprised or astonished with the differences. For example, during my work, I communicate via messages more than via calling. Sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that I was rude and insult them.
Finally, written language is more relaxed and less formal. This fact has a lot of cons and pros. I think that cons dominate under pros. What is more, it is a nice way to mix this kind of communication for best results. Neither written way nor speaking will increase your chance to be recognizable in the right way if your basic idea is not relevant to consumers of your main idea."

This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.
Hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.
On the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.
On the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.
In conclusion, the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication. This has undoubtedly advantages, such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient. Albeit, there are also clear disadvantages, for instance, the misinterpretation of the context."

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Written language has been in human history since many thousand years ago. It was first developed through ancient egyptians and other old civilizations to keep history safe and remembered. It was then reformed for learning, teaching, documenting know-how and building new civilizations. From the Latin to the modern English, an enormous amount of changes and developments have emerged. Such things were derived through the intent of humanbeings to use easier language to deliver its usages. I am of the opinion, that changing language and using it in a more relaxed way could destroy its basis and strong meanings, which it shall deliver in its original form.
Using a less formal language for writing could be associated with multiple different advantages. More people will be able to write using a language easier and faster, if it is in a more relaxed way compared to the formal version of it. So using such easy version of the language, could promotes the amount of written work, which accordingly supports the idea of keeping our culture remembered. For instance, the amount of written stories in English has doubled through the years after making the english a more easier language to apply and write with. Furthermore, such more relaxed language will help many non-fluent speakers learn and use the language faster, which shall increase the amount of people speaking this specific language.
On the other hand, a couple of critical disadvantages could be distinguished applying such strategy in the written language. Maybe the amount of written ressources increased massively in the last couple of hunderd years, but what about the quality and sophistication of such materials? Are these materials concrete, concise and accurate? Are those materials capturing the needed knowledge within the current generation successfully? These questions trigger that easier language to use doesn't neccessarily mean better documents, but rather massive irrelevant amount of expolited work.
To summarive, I tend to be of the opinion, that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of using a less formal language in writing. The long-term perspective could be significantly critisized, as only short-sighted point of views, shall think, that such methodology of written language helps human civilizations thrive in any way."

Despite the fact that poverty ratios are constantely increasing, tonnes of foods were thrown away every year. I believe that uncountable reasons could be behind this awful phenomenon, and many solutions should be taken to reduce the amounts of these wasted foods and to reduce the starvation. I will mention some in this essay.
Starting from the root causes, cooking a feast for a small group of people might be considered part of any country's culture such as many countries in the golf area, or otherwise, the person would look as stingy or even a bad host. Although some people order a huge amount of food just for the purpose of bragging, sometimes it could be due to wrong estimation of the number of guests or the portion that is needed for each individual.
Nevertheless, such matter should have immediate solutions, on both personal and global level. Governments should take all actions needed to increase the awareness of the danger of this problem and its negative consequences, whether through social media platforms or through the national TV, and to find innovative ways to hold their citizens responsible for minimising such cruical issue. Moreover, individuals should always make sure to donate the extra food to any person that is in need.
In conclusion, wasting food has been a significant issue since very long time ago. There are many reasons for this unpleasant habit, whether due to cultural impact or personal attitude; therefore, fast actions must be taken from both individuals and governments."

In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.
Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.
Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.
To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly."

This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.
The principal reason is that people are unable to finish their dishes as they often take more portions of food than they can, which can cause more food to be wasted. For instance, buffets are the most common place that wastes tons of food, especially in hotels. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.
A solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.
In conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home. It is predicted that more and more individuals will be taking away their remaining food to their accommodation and this will reduce the amount of waste food."

Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.
First and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.
Now, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.
To sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society."

This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.
To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.
A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.
In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps."

In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement and many reasons will be provide in this essay.
For the first reason, Leadership is a skill that up to a people, and it is not specific by sexes. In modern world, there are many company that let their department lead by both women and men, and to measure the result for comparing a difference that can be shown on profits that own by each section. For example, It is can be argue if the traditional company is let women firstly lead the project rather than previous, which done by a men. However if the result show profit, so it can be proof that even it is not a men the out come still worthy.
Moreover, Women emphathy in leadership is still significantly reason, we can see that people can be at ease for give more opinions by the mother nature when it come arguement or under pressure at workplace. To illustrate, The research shown comparison of two research teams. the one that lead by women tend to have more ideas post-it and opened opinions than the men team. Obviously, we must agree that women can give more friendly atmosphere for workplace and idea generation for people in her team.
In conclusion, For all reasons mentioned above we can see that a women can have better leadership than the men. For the skills that individual have or the nature emphathy that embrace the collegue."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.
The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.
In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.
To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view."

With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.
There are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people’s minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.
Despite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.
In conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender."

Do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.
First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.
The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.
All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication.

Do you agree or disagree?,"With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.
Having considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools."

Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems. I partially agree with this statement. Social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook do have a toxic influence on people's relationships. But from the other hand, communication technology enables people to communicate freely, whether a person is physically in China or in America.
The rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people's lives easier. But, there is another side of a coin – now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously. This function has blown up people's trust. Now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person, without revealing her/his personality. It is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general.
Nevertheless, modern communication technology connected so many people. For example, relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications. This function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other. Moreover, there is evidence that people have started to date each other more, because of dating applications' progress. For shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real-life communication.
To conclude, modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks. The most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity. But the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks. Communication technology gives the possibility to communicate with relatives, who are living on another edge of the planet."

Do you agree or disagree?,"In today's globalised world, the introduction of smart devices and the Internet have definitely changed the way mankind communicates. It is argued that negative consequences due to the modern communication technology can be shown in relationships of any kind. Although, some people may have difficulty to engage in person with others, the advanced devices allow human-being to mantain relationship around the world and improve their contact network.
People who believe that the introduction of new technology has negative effect on how we related to other could have a point. More human-beings are comfortable with new technologies due to the elimination of anxiety or stressful feelings triggered by face-to-face meetings. Moreover, modern devices allow erasing unprofessional or informal messages with a simple click of a button. Despite the fact that people might lose the ability to communicate correctly at the first attempt, these recent technologies offer more opportunity, encouraging shy and not confident personality.
The internet and modern devices connect people around the world expanding their connections through different continents. It is well known that creating a vast network of connections is crucial for buissness allowing expansion or firms merging. Not only it ease working meeting guarantee excellent performances from distance, but also this new technology are increasing connectivity between mankind so that friendship can be saved and language barriers can be a dwindle obstacle.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the modern communication technologies have a positive impact on mankind's life, improving their relationship, offering solution to less confident people and implementing network of connection among companies. Therefore, the positive effects of these new way of communicate far outweight the negative one's."

In today's world, people are tend to have a smartphones as their daily needs. Smartphone is designed to make people's life more easier, simpler, and accessible which can be used everywhere and anywhere. Many companies and organizations applied technology in our daily lives and it is called ""Internet of Things"" which connect the electronic devices to get access through the internet everywhere. This surely be a solution for everyone's to get access and communicate easier with other people inside the smartphone that has the applications that provided social media. Despite that, it is obvious the present of technology in mobile phone will be easier for everyone who networking with people who far away through smartphones.
Lack of communications is one of the problem that common in relationships. With using the social media to network with people more easily will be helpful for several people. Not only for communicate and connect but also for collaborate and gather ideas comfortably using platform that has provided in working areas will prevent from any kind of innarticulate.
Consequently, government and large companies has provided very pleasant program to make people communicate without any effort because of the large network that can be accessed everywhere. Furthermore, people will be sociable in just a blink of an eye."

There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.
Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history."

While others believe that in order to identify history we have to study it to help us in our modern lives. In my opinion, in the past even if they reach wonderful experiments it could be difficult to reach to our era. However, nowadays we are capable of knowing about the old history via modern technology.
On one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. Towards generations, these symbols turned into history. As a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. In fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. Moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.
On the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, In addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. For instance, Tomes Addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. Therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.
In conclusion, history is an element that can not be ignored from any period, because it could have very critical information. Finally, I believe that technology helped us recently to study those strange tools. consequently, the government should pay more attention to covering the experiment's expenses."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life.
The first point is to ignore the history experience. The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.
The second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.
I think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver. So, I think that we should thoroughly study the historical experience and use its conclusions in our present life."

Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.
To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.
Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.
Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.
To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated."

While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"This essay will talk about the importance or not of spending lots of money on family celebrations.
Family celebrations are always important, at least for catholics as it happens in my country, Spain. Nevertheless in the last decade the celebrations have started to look like something aimed to show how much money you have or you can spend. For example 30 years ago a communion celebration was a familiar meeting, going first to the church and celebrating it afterwards at home or at a restaurant with the closest members of your family. This is about to disappear. Almost every family with children receiving the communion will choose to organize a big party, inviting all family members and friends, and organizing something special for children such as going to Disneyland Park (or any other theme park). The same happens with birthday parties, it seems to be a need of improving them each year, so parents struggle to find a more original idea year by year.
On one side it is understandable, it is a human desire to celebrate family events as much as possible. I can see the point of organizing a special event for the kids in their special days (if we stick to the communion or birthay party examples). We all wish to make these days unforgettable.
But, I can´t see the point on spending so much money.
I have been a kid of the ""old school"". When I was a child there was no option, the maximum you could get from your parents was a party at home with your 3 or 4 best friends, eat losts of sweets and when geting older even a pijama party!.
In conclusion I stick to the point of less is more also in this discussion. I still believe that family celebrations must remain familiar without big events but surrounded by the ones you really love and care of."

There is an ongoing debate about whether it is essential or not to invest money in family celebrations. In my opinion, spending a lot of money on family celebration would definitely bring more precious experiences to us. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, squandering my own money for my family is significantly meaningful. Specifically, an important person for us, such as my wife or my children, may be out of my sight suddenly someday. Nobody can predict what is going to happen in the future. Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world. The compelling example of this is that having a trip with someone, surely having a good relationship, enables us to feel more satisfaction than alone. I suppose that spending money for others is a key to making myself more happier.
Having all the arguments above, I strongly recommend people spend their money on family celebrations enough to make family members satisfied."

It contains the knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and even medicine and astronomy. Developed countries holding great power and resource probably have grand teams of science professionals. But in many countries, there are only few of students have chance to take science class and study the further professional subjects. Although this situation seems biased, but this is not a referring to that these countries are less developed. There are some possible reasons.
The basic concept of science knowledge is generally given in fundamental education of many countries. In my home country, Science is a basic subject that fixed in the fundamental education system. Students come to Science in a very young age. They gain knowledge not only from textbooks, but also from experiments, and natural activities outside the school. And this kind of forms of teaching can be seen in many countries’ fundamental education. After entering the high school, not only science subject but also almost each subject are separated to more detailed subjects. Students are asked to choose a specific subject and study it, and expected to use it to be a career choice. And this is one of the potential causes of not having many students studying Science in some countries.
In developed countries, there are plenty of vacancies in different career types. For instance, we need medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, biological professionals, and even chemical and astrological professionals in the developed society to not only maintain our daily life but also to investigate and develop more advantage for the environment we are living. While in the developing or non-developed countries, there is a huge amount of the population doing farming or working in basic industrial area, which are not necessary in the usage of Science field."

There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.
There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively."

There are some countries that should teach science in wider range and value.
There are several reasons why this situation could happen -more specifically- in third world countries. First of all, lack of higher education cirtifactes holder or scientists in the fisrt place could be the reason for the small number of school professors teaching different kind of science subjects. Moreover, some people think of science as an additional subject rather than a basic life knowledge and point on these kind of lectures as secondary subjectes.
On the other hand, in result of the science negligence in these countries, we would see a lower awareness among the society which also affects the rate of science discovery and innovations. In another point of view, increasing the importance of science in life and schools could stimulate the creative minds to exceed further in every aspect of life. There are several suggestions in my opinion is important to implement in the educaion and parenting systems to ensure a adequate scientific base for childern and students. To begin with, we could add the basic subects in schools like; Physics, Chemistry and Biology as a start and then increase the complexity of the lessons and science theories each grade. Additionally, parents could read simple science books to their children from the very first years of life so they can have a good platform to the scientific ideas of the universe.
In conclusion, science is crucial for better life and future, specially to the next generation education systems. So, countries and leaders should enhance that side."

However, a lot of countries have not enough students to take part in this subject. I think that the root of this issue are money and political problems. Also, the insufficient development of science will cause some social problems.
First, to develop science, huge amount of money are required. It is necessary to establish certified facilities to provide a suitable environment for studying science and starting research. These facilities need to fulfil some international standards like ISO and IEEE which are not so easy to get, therefore the government might need to spend lots of money on building certified facilities. However, some countries dose not have such amount of money, so building certified facilities may be difficult for them to do. Second, some countries such as middle-east countries are suffering some political issues like civil war. it is difficult for them to develop science and to handle the war at the same time.
Science influence many angles of our lives. First, life will be inconvenient. For example, people living in a poor country may not have cell phone. If there is emergency that needs to be informed immediately to others, it is difficult to find them. Second, internationally, the state of country may become low because of the low living standard of populace. Business will be influenced if the country dose not have great bargaining power.

In summary, science is a key stone to develop a wealthy country. The government can modify their strategies and improve the academic environment in studying science."

What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In this essay I will discuss and showcase the reasons of not having enough studints the study science subjects and the reflection of that on the society.
The way I see this matter is there is a couple of major causes which includes the following;
Firstly, socity reasons;
Well, usually in each country pepole will lead some ideology thoughts and movments on certain topics and trends where focusing on certin major or studies considered to be the best decision that you can take which will lead to a great opportuntites for you as an indvedual and we all know that today people sees the scince as thing that will give you a knwoledge not an amazing future.
Having said that, it will directly causes an impact on the students and many of them will decides to explore another areas rather than a science subjects.
Secondly, Religious reasons
You maybe surprised to read this however, it's actullay one of the issues that causes the lack of having enough students studying science.
The best way to explain this reason is by example where in Saudi Arabia between the 1990 until 2013 a Religious were preaching peploe about the danger of studing science and that they should only focus on religion subjects.
Having that happend now will causes a lot to the society, where people will be less educated about the basics of our world.
In cunclusion, the way I see it that each countrt must enforce the studying of science subjects atleast untill the first year of college."

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"This essay will talk about the general increase in talking about money.
I will expose why I believe this is a negative development.
In worldwilde terms there has been a general society empoverishment.
In general terms, inflation has beaten the entire world very hard due to the fluctuations in energy prices, furthermore the war between Russia and Ucrania has worsen even more this fluctuation as Russia has almost stopped suppling Gas to Europe. On the other hand Ucrania was the biggest Europe´s seed warehouse and our economy at the food industry has also been affected by huge price increase.
However salaries have not been rised up enough to reach inflation rate which directly has driven society to a loss of value. This fact induces us to speak more often and more in detail about prices, about our salaries or about our home rentals. Population wonders how come our governments are not settling different actions to repair this huge loss which is causing biggest wealth inequality rates, dividing even more the society between wealthy and poors and sending a lot of population to thicken ""the under the poverty line"" population .
Newspapers and communication agencies daily inform about war status, but lately they are forgoting to insist on the economy crash we are suffering. Only in France there have been important strikes to report their disomfort with the enlargement of the retirement age as well as the general price increase.
To summarise, the economical situation worldwide is wobbling, and the least we can do is talking about it."

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.
Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!
Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.
In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life."

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. Obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. This essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.
To begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. This can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. For example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, are related to financial knowledge. This perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.
Furthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. With tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. For instance, I experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.
Although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. On one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. On the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects."

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"In modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).
This phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:
1. Inner hypocrisy;
2. Lack of confidence in oneself;
3. Thinking and vision.
First of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say ""I've made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car."" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.
Secondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, ""Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don't buy you anything nice."" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.
Finally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person's circle of friends and living environment can determine a person's thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.
In a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better."

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"It is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society. In my view, there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects, and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply.
Money is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money. Therefore, realistically, all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it. Also, in macro view, the government also care about it. the figure of GPD issues every year for measuring wealth of a country. Populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people. Regarding mental reasons, people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life. Moreover, people like competition. So we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions.
However, I think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it. First, I do not agree that money is everything. As a human being, embodying ""freedom"" is the highest value in our live. So I believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target. Otherwise, people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human. For example, we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment, and turn the topic of conversation from money to life.
In summary, Although money is necessary in our daily life, it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well. So we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money."

From a standpoint of a college student, I believe it's not a postive development that should have occurred in our modern society.
When our conversation turns to money issues, it doesn's really help up with our status quo, but only further exacerbates social anxiety by unnecessay comparison and higher expectation. I personally have similar experiences when friends start to talk about their monthly pocket money and daily luxuries they prefer. We are widely variated in family background, social classes and opportunities. If our daily social discourses are always filled with monetary issues, it is only widening the social gaps between different groups of people and making our society a place less inclusive for underprevilaged people.

Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries; people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives. This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.
Two major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.
On the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.
Although the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development. Otherwise, riots might be expected and harm social safety. Furthermore, this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison, which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur. When individuals obsess with showing off, they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides. To maintain a perfect image- especially a wealthy appearance, some people even turn to crime, such as stealing or robbery.
To conclude, folks popularly discuss money for various reasons, such as the demands of work or psychological factors. However, the phenomenon is not a positive sign to society and most likely indicates the upcoming crisis."

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.
To begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.
In addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This
means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.
Furthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students.
In conclusion, the free education system in universities must be advantageous to improve their countries' economic growth in the long term."

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes, I could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such.
To begin with, higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation, not only for themselves but for their families. In this case, governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns. For example many university students nowadays have more than one part-time jobs since they need to support themselves financially, which left no time for them to concentrate on studies.
On the other hand, despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need, the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked, by removing tuition fee in universities completely, it could derives various downsides, including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets. Take the UK as an example, private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators, compared to public schools, which have high tendency classes, and outdated teaching equipments.
To summerrise, in my perspective, the right for students to study in universities is crucial, since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies, but allows them to bring their families out of poverty. However, people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely, such as poor quality of teaching. Therefore, I could only partially agree with such opinions."

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.
There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.
And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.
If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.
In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.
The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.
To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.
Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation."

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.
On the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.
On the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of ""inspiration"" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.
In summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help."

So having great public schools to fundamental level, enable all students to been accept or get the approval for any univerties and even to requires a schoolarship, when it is necessary. Governments shouldn't spend public money in graduation or higher level education, in order to keep all efforts on be the number one in fundamental education.
Another public politic which may shows a good results is provide a specials credit lines for students who haven't enouth money to pay full tuition fees. These type of credit might create a sense of responsability and encourage students to loooking for a good job as soon as they've concluded the course. This kind of financial should consider that payment only starts after the end of their course.
In conclusion, I would argue that having the government paying the fees for university studies isn't looks to be a good solution to guarantee an university access for whole population. States should keep investing and execute their role to persue the best fundamental public education and might enable their students to get into any university. If those student haven't enouth money or condition to pay all fees, states only need to provide a special credits to them."

To begin with, this could make universities more inclusive and help some students achieve their dreams. Some people, due to their economic background, are forced to attend specific establishments, even though they would give anything to be somewhere else. This is an important cause of class differences, and the source of many disciminations today. This is why, offering to pay for their course fees, would considerably help students that are less wealthy, and fight against inequalities.
To illustrate this argument, here is an example. Some of my class-mates receive a specific amount of money from an organization, that helps them study at my shool. They find it amazing because, now they are not only defined by their parents' income anymore, and they have the opportunity to accomplish whatever they wish in life.
Secondly, an enormous amount of students live in a precarous situation, so by paying their course fees they could have a more stable life. University life is rough, you are not with your family, you have to manage so many different things for the first time, one of which being money. Some students have little to no money that they can spend in recreational activities, a big part of it being assigned to accomodations, school fees and food. By paying some of their fees, students could benefit from the money and do what they enjoy. This could help them mentally and make them enjoy life a bit more.
On the other hand, I can understand that if governments had to pay for the course fees of every students, it would represent a tremendous amount of money that could be invested in other and more pressing matters. Although, I do still think that providing this aid could have more benefits than downsides.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education. I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.
To start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.
On the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.
In conclusion, paying for course fees is a good idea but only for those students who have enthusiasm for studying"

In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021.
Seoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers
On the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor.
As we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases. The success in hosting international games depends on many elements. Time of the game is important, and global atmosphere is important as well. Most of all, how well the country is prepared is a key factor that the event can be successful."

From my point of view, It is a brilliant idea for the country and for citizens when they host and are owners of international sports events.
On the one hand, arranging a sport event is always hugely expensive. In democratic societies there is always a doubt if these expenditures are appropriate or not. Sometimes it could be thought-provoking about spending this money on charity, medical insurance or to reduce juvenile delinquency for example. Also, there are people who are not fans or spectators, for them this kind of expensive event is not interesting. For instance, in Russia it is a fact that the winter olympic games in 2014 had a lot of controversial ideas about whether it was really necessary or not. I remember that in that time were a lot of discussion in TV and in the internet,
On the other hand, when your country hosts an international sport event it is a nice chance to show how rich your country is and express solidarity in your society. It is a fact that events like this, for example ""eurovision"" or ""olympic games"" and other worldwide events help to create an interconnection between countries and cultures. During these events we can see what happens in other countries and how people there live. For example, in 2018 Russia hosted a world football games, and this event invited a large number of foreign specialists and investors.
In conclusion, although hosting international sport events could be very expensive, the benefits which it could give to the citizens and to government institutes overload any disadvantages. I believe that each country should try to do it more."

While there are little advantages for some countries throwing such a sports event, I am convinced that holding an international sports event benefits the hosting country.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why in some situations people think it is bad for a country to host an international sports event. In the first place, average people draw more attention to daily necessities and medical treatments. They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.
On the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy. Hosting an international sports event spurrs the economy and provide large quantities of employment for people, which revives and thrives all various industries. Apart from that, a sports event held by a country advocates the theme of health and sports, encouraging people there to lead a green positive attitude towards life, as well as setting up its renowned international position. Therefore, after the event, excellent businessman and geniuses all around the world will be attracted to invest there.
In conclusion, I can understand why people are unwilling to hold an international sports event, but it seems to me that more advantages of hosting one event like that outweigh than that of not conducting one."

I think that to teach the science of food can help to save money and to avoid disease. On the other hand, it is important teach them climate change and other topic like biochemistery which are essential.
First of all, it is important to teach in our school how are composed food and how to cook them without spend a lot of money. On reason of that, is because we had spam of advertising around us and, if we did'nt have the good information, we could be more guillible and buy fast food. This misinformation could lead to waste money and poor choice for our health. For example, if you don't know where find carbohydrate, fiber and protein, you will choose the bad food and listen marketing.
In fact, nutrition is not the only subjet which is important, that our time is limited. Moreover, with global warming, our world could encounter a huge challenge during the next century. For instance, climate change and global warming are more important for their education rather than science of nutrition, because they need to be prepared to these big change.
In my point of view, it is important to teach nutrition to our children, because that could lead at an improvement of their health and lifestyle. In contrast, it is not the only issue in the world and they needed to know the fundamental knowledge about the world like chemistery, biology, physic to understand more advanced topics. For example, how can they understand why would needed protein if they didn't understand biochemistery.

Some people think there is not so much to learn about food, but I think that is wrong. There are lots of different way of preparing food, and it takes lots of time to master them. Also, science behind food is very complex, but it is significant in our life. I will demonstrate my opinion in detail in this essay.
First of all, food is a critical part of a life. In many culture, having and preparing food is considered one of the most important activities to live a enjoyable life. By having a delicious food, one can feel happiness uncomparable to anything. Moreover, preparing food for someone like family or lover is a tremendously rewarding activity. By preparing food for them, you can show how much you care about them, and share your emotions with them. To enjoy this amazing part of life, it is very important to learn how to prepare food and what makes delicious food.
Secondly, It is crucial to know about how the food effect their health. Some people say 'A human body is a sum of what they have eaten in their life', because The food they ate become a part of their body in the end. We get most of nutritions we need from food. Thus, how we eat massively affect our health. It is scientifically proven that the food culture of a country significantly effect the health status of the people. Therfore, knowing about how the nutritions in food affect our body is very important to leave a healthy life.
For this reason, it is crucial to teach about food to students in schools. Food can be a means of communication sometimes, and it can be a precious present that is given to a life. Moreover, food is a source of energy that sustain us, and sometimes it is a medicine that cure our body. Hence, students should study about how to prepare a good food, and understand how it can affect us by its nutritions."

Thus, this essay discusses how creating an understanding of good nutrition, health and well-being it’s important for students to support positive learning and development.
Modern society with the advertisement of fast food and new products rich in sugar is addressing children and teenagers to choose junk food over healthy. Thus, it is important for schools to introduce the science of food into their curriculum. This subject can positively influence the students’ choices about nutrition creating knowledge about food categories, compositions and nutritional values. For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.
Contrarily, there’s the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy. It might be true as not everyone could be interested in learning about food. However, if observing in detail the science of food, it is evident that it involves a series of challenging topics such as chemistry, biology, food engineering and microbiology.
To sum up, while some people think that introducing the science of food could be detrimental to students’ learning as it would reduce the time available for more didactical subjects, on the other hand, learning about food and its composition, can be beneficial as it provides with the knowledge that can support healthy eating and wellbeing."

Both types of learning have advantages as well as drawbacks and this essay will highlight both sides of the situation.
The knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level. For example, they become capable of making a career in the food industry or conducting further research on the science of food at the tertiary level. Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.
However, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.
In my opinion, students studying at schools should use their valuable time for learning essential subjects as it helps them succeed in the future. Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life. For example, adult learners are able to join an academic course on food science as many institutions provide face-to-face and online courses in this regard. However, knowledge of subjects such as science, business studies, and arts is inevitable to achieve success in the future. Hence, the potential time of school students should be utilized to learn necessary subjects for a better outcome."

Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.
Nevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment. Eventually, with a long life and a good business or career, they will have a wealthy life ahead and, indeed, their life positively impacts others.
To conclude, students with a balanced knowledge of academic and non-academic subjects will have a bright future with a healthy and wealthy life."

While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.
The insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
Pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.
In conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects."

It is so essential that most schools provide computers in the classrooms for their students. However, if the student is too dependent on computers, it will have two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.
If we go back twenty years, only a few schools already have computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there will always be risks involved with that. In this case, a student who relies so much on computers may need more social skills, as the interaction between student and teacher will be less, that caused by the materials and exercises will be delivered online or by any application programs.
Despite the risks, there are also several benefits that students can gain from computers. First, it will provide much positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned and exercises to be done anywhere and anytime. Besides that, a computer will assist the teacher when reviewing the student's homework.
In conclusion, the benefits of computer dependency in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. Eventually, students can study more anywhere and anytime, although there will be a risk related to social concern."

What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world. As a result, the computers do give people all kind of convience including quickly knowledge and repeatable education. However, the dependence to the computers is really harmmful to both of students and teachers.."

However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price.
With regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine.
In order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking.
In conclusion, people who smoke cannot change this habit due to Nicotine in a cigarette which can be addressed by governmental policy to raise the price of a cigarette with the view to promote citizens to cease smoking and take care of their health instead."

In one hand , smokers are luch of awareness alternative of stress reduction. Thus most of the smoker believe that smoking is the best solution to releave the stress that they face in their daily lives. For example, nowadays we see many of employees are smoking during their working hours to beat the stress and headache. So that is why some people think that quit smoking is a negative point that can effect them directly .
On the other hand, majority of the smokers must have tried quitting smoking at least once in thier live time. Frankly it is extrmely hard to kick this habit. However, in the 90th some studies shows the facts that all of smokers can get the medical treatment for a while which can leave them to quit smoking forever. This prove clearly that smoking is just a habit.

This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.
One of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked “cool” and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.
Even though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.
In conclusion, it can be said that most people start smoking at a young age when they are most vulnerable to develop bad habbits and that is why social awareness campaigns have to be done to prevent the young generation from getting addicted to cigarettes."

Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.
Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.
I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.
In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society."

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.
Evidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.
However, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.
To conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments."

This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.
Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.
In conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation."

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Although it is well known that smoking causes severe damage to our bodies, many people cannot reduce the bad habit. This is a big problem because many people die of lung cancer every year, and social welfare expenditures are expensive. The point is why so many people continue to smoke and how we can let them stop smoking. In this essay, I will provide two reasons and related examples to solve the questions.
First of all, once people are addicted to smoking, they cannot stop smoking without help. In my experience, my father was a heavy smoker. He wanted to quit smoking but could not do that by himself. Thus, he went to a hospital and met a well-experienced counselor. After my father got advice and medicine, he could cut the bad habit. Therefore, a counselor's help is definitely necessary.
Secondly, cigarettes are still relatively cheap compared to alcohol. For instance, tobacco was very reasonable in Japan, my home country, several decades ago. Thus, so many people had the habit of smoking rather than drinking alcohol. Then the Japanese government raised the tax rate on cigarettes from 20 percent to 50 percent in order to strongly discourage people from smoking. Consequently, the smoking rate dropped dramatically. As Japan's case shows, the rise in the tax rate is quite effective in reducing smoking in a country.
There are probably many people who have different opinions and disagree with my way of thinking. However, considering the two specific reasons and related examples indicated above, I personally believe that addiction and low price are the two main factors of smoking and that the remedies for them are a counselor's advice and raise of tax."

Although
there are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.
Initially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.
On the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class
everyday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.
Finally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.
homework is necessary for children more than anything."

Many said ""yes"" and many said ""no"". Both sides have good and strong reasons, so let's compare them wisely.
On the ""homework is bad for students” side, most people argue that most homeworks is time consuming, and forces students to do it instead of spending their free time afterschool. This also keeps the students inside the house instead of letting them be active and explore the surroundings. Some even said doing homework gives tiredness, stress, and boredom, especially on exam seasons. It also slowed down the social skills development of active students. Many people agreed that homeworks and assignments should be given in another time, instead of after school time, so students could have time to rest at home.
On the other hand, ""homework is good for students'' side argued that most homeworks is designed to be done in around fifteen to thirty minutes (Or in other cases thirty minutes to an hour), and students still have time to rest and enjoy their life. Also, imagine if students don't have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.
If students can manage their time, they won't feel stressed or tired. Because they didn't do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore. Or because they do their homework and do other things at the same time. They will get easily distracted, but if you do it focusly, everything will be good. Also you will be prepared for the next lesson.
So I agreed that homework is good for you, as long as it is optimized and isn't time consuming. If teachers are abusing it, then it will became a good way to torture students."

In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.
Personally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.
From my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.
Having said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, homework should be given in order to allow student to understand how to flourish indipendently, but simultaneously, the amount of homework load should be re-evaluated."

One of the main drawback of homework is the amount of time and effort it usually requiers. In a lot of schools homework takes at least several hours to do which can be a lot after a long school day. Another issue with homework are the mark that students get because the can affect a mental health of a developing child a lot.
However, homework can help students work on their skills and give a deeper understanding of the subject in question. Homework can be very helpful when a student is sick or absent in the class to process all the materials at home. It is also very common situation when a struggling student raised his marks by doing homework which improved his skills in a long run.
Personally, I think homework is essential part of schooling. It teaches you responsibility, for example by meeting your deadlines, and helps process knowledge that you gained in class. In addition, homework teaches teenagers to learn which is the most important skill everyone should gain at school.

Traditionally, schools have used homeworks as a pivotal tool to support children´s education. However, in the past few years, some schools have piloted a homework-free approach. I believe that homework-based schools provide a more nurturing and effective education compared with homework-free schools.
Having homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. They might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. However, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. Similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. Both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. Additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. Therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. Finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.
On the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. These children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. They could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. Since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. Finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.
To conclude, homework-based schools have more advantages for children than homework-free schools. Therefore, homeworks are still an important tool to improve the learning experience of children around the world."

Before we start discuss both these views. we have to know the meaning of the economic, you dear reader might know the general meaning but do you have any idea about what is the deep meaning of the economic. lets take a short tour.
When someone says ""economic"" he often means any thing realted to money, banks, industries, big companies, anything that making money its under economic, even when you are a tourist in somewhere in whole world you making the economic in the country that you live in for a few days go up.
Goverements argue that economic is very important than other for a list of reasons, lets know about some of them.
- They think if everything is related to economy then it most be more important than anything els.
- As the economy is almost ruling everything. so if they focous on the country's economy any other problem will be solved directly.
Now we know governments opinion, shall we beagan to look at the oposite view?
- People who take the other side, think that when the government works only on the economy, the education and the other important things will be going down.
- when the other thing going down the economy will not be survaivd either.

The economy of a country is directly co-releated to its quality of life. Nonetheless, there are other goals, equally important, which are usually unattended. In this essay I will asses whether or not economic progress should be the most important goal of a government.
Firstly, money has huge importance due to the fact that it provides power. Furthermore, the most powerful countries are those who have more money. However, in the end, the value of a country is not measured by the amount of money it has, but by its education. A rich country is the one composed by educated people and that should be the main focus of a government. In fact, a country made of intelligent and resourceful people will somehow manage to increase its wealth, whereas if made of lazy people it will be doomed to poverty.
Secondly, everything related to money and consecuently, economic progress, is always linked to greed. Aditionally, a gorverment that suffers from greed makes wrong decisions consistently. For instance, my birth country; Spain. If you dig into the spanish history you will see a huge number of greedy and unethical decisions made in seek of economic progress such as the american conquest.
All things considered, economic progess is a vital goal but not the most important one. Goverments should focus on more valuable things like education. Moreover, decisions regarding economy should never guided by greed. From my point of view, governments shoud give economic progress less importance and attend other matters such as education or social aids. If they create a real change with their decisions, economic progress will eventually be achieved."

On the one hand, prioritizing economic progress is important because it is the basis that sustains every countries' needs.

On the other hand, other types of progress such as educational, technological and health developements can lead to better outcomes in society. For instance it has been proven that countries with the best quality of education tend to be more peaceful and have less crime rates than those where education is not a priority.

Hence, many goverments worldwide believe that their primary objective is to focus on the development of goods and services. Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.
Firstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.
However, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.
To conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come."

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.
To begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.
Apart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.
In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies."

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays in many educational buildings bullying is became an enormous issue. From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.
To start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.
Having said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.
To sum up, in order to address the right solutions, that can be different from one child to another, school schould understand the cause of bullying throughout counseling and then help the student out."

It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.
First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.
Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.
In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems."

I think that now a days our society is experiencing a transformation of values and with these transformation a lot of thes important values are saturating to get forgotten.
I think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.
Continuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.
Also i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. Explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. Tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.
Like ones president Benito Juárez said ""The respect to the right of others is the peace"".
When i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. In may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.
So also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. Tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.
These could be by going with a authority ( teacher, principal, etc) or to try to stop it."

From my point of view, they are doing this because of the benefits accrued from the importance of practising hobbies. For example, people who give time to their hobbies feel less stress from who do not. Another reason why practising hobbies a day in a week is vital for some people, because they want to change their daily routine of work and stressful life.
Hobbies have positive effects on a person. It is vital for his/her mental and pshycal health
by keeping their mind refreshed and maintaining balance of their well-being. For instance, doing a hobby like football or other kinetic hobbies has a significant impact on person's stamina. Furthermore, it is a good chance to move his muscle and prevent premature aging in many individuals.
The crucial influences of allocating time to hobbies that we can see on society are the importance of them in improving the family life which consquently will enhance the social life and the society. There are a lot of social hobbies like going to the cinema or travelling which a family can take a part in it and that will make an excellent environment between a father and his childreen and his wife as well.
As we have seen, allocate time to hobbies has a significant impact on the individual and the society which could help all concerned to emphasis on this feature to develop their abilities and alleviate the side effects of this stressful life."

This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.
First, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.
Also, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.
These phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find ""Pride and Prejudice"" unfamiliar, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" alien to them.
People losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.
To sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football. It will cause negative effects, like losing appreciating abilities, and causing problems to the economy."

The truth is that avocation used to be a vital part of every individual's life routine but the question is why most people become do not spend their time doing their hobbies and what the effect of it on the individual and society.
While it is held belief that the avocation is needed time, but lifestyle become different for many people these days,they feel should be working almost of their time to can provide the primary needs for themselves or for children, because everything become expensive. So They spend most of their energy during work by the site for a long period in their office , so after they back home just need to relax and sleep.
On one hand, The most important one is the invasion of technology in our lives. Most people spend hours on cell phones, chatting, online shopping and generally surfing various websites such as Twitter and Fakebook. eat away most of the precious time that can be spent doing some healthy activity.
Therefore, it is having an adverse effect on the individual and society. The health problem increased a few years ago , especially heart diseases, diabetes and depression, community have become more distant from each other , and lack of feel peace in most of the people .
In conclusion , avocation is a healthy source to make the public more creative and have good health , where they can lose a lot of stress and develop their skills in a different field , away from work or other routine problems. But quite doing that led to many issues that the people found difficult to deal with it."

They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.
Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.
Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.
Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.
This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.
In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place."

People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.
Needless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.
On the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.
To sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and “tendency to be depressed” of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life. We need to think more about that problem because, in my opinion, we are really close to be as emotional and alive as robots."

Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldn’t be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.
It is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.
Nevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage can’t be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.
To sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety."

It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.
Traffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.
However, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.
In my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body. One can beat traffic if they wake up earlier, they can also choose to go to the gym or not. Why do I say that? We have people in the less populated areas who are unwell or obese while we have those living in big towns and are in great physical and mental shape."

Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.
By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.
On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.
To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources."

To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.
To begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.
On the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.
In conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online."

To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.
The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banks
and even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.
For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.
In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements."

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.
On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.
On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?
The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.
To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits"

And others strongly argue that keep changing is more important to catch up with this society. Although some peoples opinion, working the same things feel relieved and stable in their life, I strongly recommend it is necessary to keep changing, and practicing to get along with this fast paced society.
It is often stated that some people are willing to work on monotonous tasks, and keep doing the same tasks is commendable, and be taken as the virtue, especially in Japan. For example, there are sophisticated handcrafts and the craftsmen are often valued and praised to some extent. Therefore, some jobs, including traditional crafts are necessary to maintain Japanese great culture.
On the other hand, technology has been developing in recent years. Robot and IT technology have drastically improved in a few decades. Surprisingly, some robots started to serve meals to customers' tables in some restaurants in Japan. This means that technology will take the place of many jobs which used to be handled by people. Therefore, people need to upskill in a variety of work for the future.
Finally, it is unpredictable which industries and jobs are no longer necessary by human work or other industries will appear in the future. The only thing people can do is observe and predict the social environment, and update their own skills. For example, if people perceived IT programming will be more demandable, and working the same tasks in the factory will be taken by a robot, they should start learning IT programming and other demandable skills as soon as possible.
In conclusion, people kept updating their own skills from ancient times. Therefore, people are required to change their lifestyles, and jobs to meet the rapid social improvements and changes. As a result, people will get used to this pace and be more creative."

They were doing almost the same routine every day, going to the same bookshop or gorceries on weekend and same things to do at work. There are not much changes in their lives. Others like to living in the changing environment. They keep trying new things, go to the different restrauants or meeting new friends. Sometimes they even challenging themselves by moving to other positions at work.
I agree with both views because these two views are not conflict. One can meeting new friends in the same coffee store or can meeting old friends in different coffee sotres. The change and unchange only represent some parts of their lives. Like the aforementioned example, one can go to the same gorcery shop every weekend but go out with different friends at Saturday night. Or one can go to different cafes but to have the same order of coffee.
The change and unchage are exist in each other. The world is changing all the time that no one can walking in the same street twice. This is a philosephy saying. Because as time flows the stree that you stepped on was no longer the same street, the leaves may change or the tree may changeBut if that is the same path you walk to company every day, it is the same street in your plan. That means the street is relatively changed/unchaged. On one can stop the world changing, and what can be unchange is ourself, or our minds. We can have the same mindset everyday in different environments."

In this article I am going to demonstrate the reasons behind why people prefer to eliminate any chance to change.
To illustrate, I belive that there are too kinds of people, the kind which they prefer to change freqentily to try new things or to improve their life or to develop any shortage things they relies that they have to change. In the other side we have the people which feels more peaceful when they avoid any changes more then when they add any things new to there life. In addition, this group of people have another reasons that explain why they did not attind to change, the reasons about the space which they get from the stability, the new things make them feel more confuse.
In conclusion, there are many approaches to live in this planet, in my opinion the people which have more interest to try new things they have the ability to think in critivty way and see the details in any thing they will face also they have the fast dicison skills comparing the other people because they try new things constant and have the confidant etheir. while the conservative people have no flexibility to make fast decision or to think by using new tools, but the advantage for them are they look like have more wise thinking."

Hence, it is complicated to agree or disagree with one of these way of thinking, the choice is personal. However, trying something outside of the normal routine could bring improvement in lifes.
Change is an important topic in our modern world where everything moves and evolves so quickly and people do not have the time to reflect on the present. Therefore, it is understanding if someone is afraid of it and prefer to have the same habits, spending their life doing the exact same circle of thing week after week. This is call comfort-zone. Everyone aims at it at some point of their life because it is reassuring, easy and releaxing. But does it brings in people's life important events or news? The answer most likely is no. If people do not go out of their comfort-zone, choosing changes over habits, they will never experience something new. In the long run people become unsatisfied, depressed holding negative thoughts and unhappy.
On the other side, changes are bringing new scenario in mankind's life that can improve, most of the time, their situation. For instance, when a human-being is frustrated by his/hers job, he/she should try to get a new one. Best case scenario he/she will feel more appriciated by it. The point is that this person has not lost anything by this change, because he/she still have an employment.

Nowadays, living together before deciding to get married, is a common trend specially by young couples. I strongly agree that sharing a life before heading to the next level of a relationship, is a positive way to get to learn each other better.
First and foremost, by living together the couple will learn some of the bad habit the other one has such as brushing the teeth in the kitchen sink, leave the dishes in the sink for another time to clean them and more. It is important, that the person is aware of such behaviour, so when they get married, it is not a surprise. Additionally, the individual has enough time to deal with it or to make a negative decision. Moreover, they can talk about it and look together for solutions.
By living together the individuals share the bills and other invoices. Thus, they will find out if the other one is reliable and able to pay the bills on time. There is enough evidence, that the finances are a challenge in many relationships. You want to make sure that the bills are paid on time. In many relationships, the individuals share a bank account specifically to pay invoices, trust a priority, indeed. For example, you do not want to need to pay for your expenses and the bank account is emptied by your partner.
On the other hand, in many conservative cultures and societies, people can only move together after marriage. The individuals do not know whom they will be sharing their lives. Thus, much has to be learnt and accepted due to the fact, that getting divorced is not accepted.
To sum up, living together before getting married has a myriad of advantages. Thus, I am of the view, that it is beneficial to live together and get to learn each other well before taking the next step."

People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.
In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.
Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.
What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned."

However, as our society keeps developing, more and more people start to accept the idea of cohabitation and put it into action. Admittedly, cohabitation can be advantageous. However, I do believe that people need to exercise caution when making the decision of living together with a partner.
It is true that living together with one's partner is a great opportunity for couples to know their partners as well as life after marriage better. Lovers tend to love each other so much that they can easily miss some tiny but crucial details or habits of their significant other. Cohabitation makes these details and habits unavoidable since two people are basically seeing each other for hours on a daily basis. Cohabitation can also be a buffer to help young couples move into a new stage in their lives. However, despite the fact that people are expected to completely understand their husband or wife-to-be as well as marriage itself, it is not guaranteed that they will still make the decision to marry that person after cohabitation.
Some people find it difficult or even dangerous to put the idea of cohabitation into implementation. Lovers in a long-distance relationship, for example, usually reside in different cities and can only see each other once in a while. In such situations, cohabitation means that one person must give up his or her career. This seems to be unfair and may lead to unnecessary breakups. Another instance is that some people can use cohabitation to, financially or sexually, take advantage of other people.
All in all, many advantages can be attributed to cohabitation, but I still think that people need to be cautious before moving in with a partner."

In this essay I am going to explain the two main views people hold on this subject.
A sizeable number of people argue that children would be best served by being taught at home rather than turning up at school , because of the highly comfortable and utterly familiar environment, which allow them to being involved into attending lessons as well as doing assignments more effectively and reducing distractions. As a result , thanks to the time-saving, the children may have enough time to spent for their leisure and sport activities.
However, many others beg to differ, claiming that a laptop cannot replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances, since the lack of direct relationship in that specific stage of age might be detrimental not only to children’s school marks, but for themselves.
Moreover, those who hold this current of thought contend that being a student-at-home come at the cost of concentration, as such a comforting background may shift children focus toward more appealing activities, standing in stark contrast with the former view aforementioned.
To my mind, I believe that COVID experience has provided some insight that could help us to take the stock of the situation in this vein, namely, the flurry of psychological ailments of which the children were suffering during the lockdown were mostly sparked by their isolation toward their peers, it found.
Consequently, it means that relationship restriction would lead to depression which in turn, affects the mental processes underlying the school performances overall. Hence, it is reasonable to think that children are better off studying at school along with their mates rather than in a more reclusive way such as doing it alone at home."

For the reason that kids are the future. Some people prefer their kids to get home-educated, while others believe that it is important for them to go to school. I am a strong advocate that children must go to school for a variety of reasons, wich will be mentioned in this essay.
To commence with, eventhough it is important to get a proper education and this can be found in both schools and at home, however, going to school on a daily basis can garantee the kid to communicate with his/her peers. And this can be in a negative or positive way- nowadays, but no matter which way the kid experiences, it is still going to be an experience that the kid will develop and learn from after. And it will assist bulding the child's character, in addition to, other fundemental traits. Like for example, gaining self-esteem, and leading skills, and so on ...
Likewise, it is children nature to be too energetic- generally speaking- so going to school, and playing with their friends, can be the best way for them to get rid of this energy. For instance, if the kid was running around the house, he propably would get scolded by his parents. Because at home there is no much space like outside. In addition, it is for the child's physical health to be active and go outside, not stay at home all day.
Overall, I believe that it is a better option for them to go to school instead of getting home-schooled. As well as, communication and playing with other children which can be a proper way for them to get developed mentally and pysically."

Although teaching at home sometimes provided a more comfortable environment, I believe that making children go to school is better for their development.
On the one hand, studying at home always provides a comfortable environment for children. When children study at some place they live and stay every day, they tend to be more relaxed, it can encourage children to study in better efficiency. In addition, education plans can be customized if children are going to study at home, and maximize their advantages in talents. Take the case of Lang Lang, who was a famous Chinese musician, he was found talented in piano since he was the age of 5 and started long-term customized piano training at home, eventually becoming the champion of the Chinese national piano competition in his 20s. Furthermore, parents can take care of children’s study progression, difficulties, and mental health the first time, and make corresponding adjustments in time.
On the other hand, it perhaps better for children’s development to let them get used to go to school. Firstly, despite the comfortable, simple environment at home, children could not always stay inside their “green house” once they grew up, they need to develop the ability to be compatible with the pressures that come from a more complex social environment, while school can be their first step to practicing such ability. Secondly, it is necessary for children to learn and apply team collaboration skills in order to overcome some difficulties that could not be solved by a single person. Finally, school is the first platform that enables children to develop their own networking, which is a kind of wealth that can help their personal development in the future. For example, many typical famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Winston Churchill all started to develop strong social networking since they were in school, and the networking provided them with vital help on their path to success.
In conclusion, I can understand why people might want children to be taught at home, but I strongly hold the opinion that it’s better for children’s development to send them to school."

Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.
There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.
On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.
All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people."

While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.
It is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.
However, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.
From my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.
To conclude, both methods of education either home based or school based have their benefits. Every person should decide for themselves what is better for them or their childrens."

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.
To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.
Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.
To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in."

Many countries in Europe or Asia supported the legal marriage in LGBTQs, howere in some religious culture, the topic are very sensitive to be discussion and in worsely the LGBTQs were banned.
Love and being in the relationships depend on people' s mutual feeling. There is no boundaries of love, even they have same gender or different races, or even speak the different languages. Therefore, if they decided to settle down and live the rest of their lives together, the social determinants will be no longer to influence the relationship.
It is acceptable for the caring and understanding to maintain their marriage lives. As long as they could stay together and share thick or thin time together. The couple could have the good qualities of lives, some developed countries supported and launched legal LGBTQs marriage.
In conclusion, I strongly agree with legal LQBTQs marriage, so far they could share the moment together , they could extend their life expectancy and they could build the everlasting love until the last days of their lives. To love is to cherish their moments together."

Many people view it as a legal right for individulas to marry whatever person, regardless of gender, they consider as a suitable partner. Others, however, believe that gay marriage should be illegal, as it spreads the notion that being gay is normal.
Certainly, both paries make some sound arguments supporing their views, and it is not effortless to decide which side to pick. Nevertheless, governments should not be basid towards any party's views, and a decision from the government must be based on the values and principles of its nation.
People supporing gay marriage claim that governments and individuals should not have the right to decide for people who to marry, as it damages the well-being of those individulals. Moreover, they argue that gayness is not a new tread that has just given a birth, but a natural behavior that has been existed among some types of animals for centuries.
People opposing gay marriage, however, claim that such a behavior will destory society as gay partners cannot reproduce, and thus, the population number will start gradually decrease. Opposiers also ague that if gay marriage was a natural behavior, religion would have advised to do it rather than giving severe warning for people who practice such behavior.
In conclusion, while both sides have countless followers, many governments around the world are leaning towards being fine with homosexual marriage. Personally, I think that every individual has the right to do whatever he desires as long as he does not affact others in the process."

This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking.
On the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food.
Finally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop."

While both have effects on the childs habits from an early age, i think that it is mostly the parents fault.
It is debated that childhood obesity is mainly the parents responsibility for various reasons. Many parents schedueles and lifestyles are not fit for having a child as their routines are not flexible enough to properly take care of him/her. For example, in most western houses, both the mother and the father have jobs to attend everyday, and dont return home to their children till the late afternoon. By that time, the parents will both be too exausted to properly look after their child, which will lead to him/her eating any food no matter its quality and source such as fast foods and sweets, which are calorie dense and low volume. Furthermore, studies have shown that around 42 percent of parents in the United States did not care what their child consumed given it was cheap and does not require preparation. As far as i am concerned, this is enough evidence to justify it being mostly the parents fault.
On the other hand, others argue that it is primarely the governments fault. Governments have complete control over what advertisements can or cannot be portrayed to the public. Knowing that most advertisements we see are related to fast food chains and chocolate bars, we can deduce that it undoubtebly has a major effect on children which will beg their parents. to try some of this food. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that fast foods contain substances which encourage addiction. So when fast foods are easily accesible no matter which city you are in, parents will have a hard time controlling which foods their children eat. I agree that the government has a major influence on children, but their parents have greater controll over them.
In conclusion, while the government is undoubtebly the root of obesity amongst children, it is completely up to the parents to either develop this problem or put limitations to it."

As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.
On the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.
However, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.
On the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.
Nevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.
To conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people."

A lot of people may agree with this because they think that the government does not take measures to stop selling high sugar products, which may cause obesity, in schools. Moreover, they may suggest that government is also responsible for junk food advertisements because it is not forbidden yet. For instance, if children see a french fries and hamburgers advertisement in cartoons they are watching, they may want to eat fast food every day to be like their favourite cartoon character who enjoys the same meal.
On the other hand, some people are convinced that only parents are responsible for their own kids. They understand that children's food and sports habits are similar to those which their parents have. For example, if human beings explain to their kids how food influences physical and mental health and cook fresh, healthy dishes for the whole family every day, no one will want to buy fast food or even overeat.

Every parent hopes that their kids can have better and more skilled to face the challenges in the future. At this time, extra classes came into being. Besides the lessons in school, children will attend different kinds of extra classes, such as classes on sports, maths, languages, arts. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile thing to do, but children shouldn't be given too much pressure.
Students in school usually have 5-6 classes, and after school they need develop their hobbies and have more time to do outdoor activities with their friends or classmates. In class , they get the knowledge from teachers and textbooks while after school they learn from experiencing the life, getting into nature and make connections by social skills. So I think students can have some extro classes not for studing the knowledge but for experencing, developing, and make themselves be themselves, become a whole person.
My son is an active boy who loves sports and he is into riding horses, play badminton and swimming. So I chose to take him to the club of horse riding on Tuesday after school . On Thursday, he will go to attend the swiming class with his friends. They not only learn the swimming skills from teacher but aslo have geat fun, and I always see his smiling face. I found that more sports and hobbies can really make the kids feel relaxed instead of some bored extra maths, languages classes. Kids need improve and learn new skills so as to have a better and brighter future, extra classes are needed ,but not too many or not too heavy. Be a whole person and be themselves is more important."

Consequently, employees are requested to have a variety of knowledge in their jobs due to remain a highly competitive capabilities in labour markets over the world. Parents have much struggles on the arrangement regarding additional classes out of school to their children in order to gain the competitive advantages in their future career. This eassy attempts to find out the main considerations on this.
There is no doubt that school curriculum largely focuses on academic studies, including physical, Maths and organic chemistry etc., Those subjects are designed to connect with learning in a higher education. It is reasonable to say that this curriculum may not enable the teenagers to gain various knowledeges aspects of digital world and our planet. Learning in extra classes out of syllabus is an opportunity for them to really discover what they may be passionate about and in turn, help them develop new skills that may come in handy for a future occupation that is related.
On the other hand, it is not difficult to notice a lot of parents forcing their children into learning something that does not interest them. Sometimes, the intensive courses are arranged by parents to their children study at the weekends. As a result, it could lead to undesired results or even negative impacts on the parent-child relationship, so maybe it's best for children to figure it out on their own sometimes.
My take on this is that younsters are extremely inquisitive and energetic, consequently, it's really the prime time of their life to explore and learn new things. Studying in classes outside the syllabus are good intention, but children are forced to learn what their parents love to only. This not only ruins the parent-child relationship but also may results in children's resistance to learning."

However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.
To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.
On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.
To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying."

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.
When it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.
Although playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.
Having discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial. Almost all walks of life require communication with others, so skills developed in teams are more advantageous then those in person."

However, which between individual or team is most useful and salutary is a question that stir up fierce debate amongst public opinion.
To start with, beginning a team sport activity since from the childhood has countless advantages, first of all, it helps connecting athletes one another in an engaging and ever- stimulating experience.
Secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.
Nevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often one’s overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.
In contrast, individual sports require a precise mindset and the natural flair for breaking the mold along with the urge to take on themselves in a never-ending clash under the banner of “ may the best man win”.
However, anyone can undertake such an activities, whose undoubtedly beneficial health effects, come into their own.
Although the spirit of challenge is equally through the roof in comparison with team sports, the absence of mates to confront with may, in the long run, leads the individual player to become decidedly more reclusive and self-reliant.
According to my experience, I would not have become companionable and self-reliant if I had not joined the basketball team when I was 9 years old. Moreover, playing with others, has helped me to pushing my limits further ahead without breaching those of my teammate, being a sort of example to follow and a beacon to turn to, in case of needs."

To my point of view, I prefer individual sports over team sports as the latter is more harmful and less beneficial from both physical and mental perspective.
Firstly, I think sports played in groups tend to cause more harm in the forms of stress and injuries. To start, virtually all team sports are played as competitions: it must have a winnner and a loser, or losers. Since no one wish to be the stepstone of the champion, it causes a tremendous amount of stress on players' psyche. Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.
On the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).
In conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views."

Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.
Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.
Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.
Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.
In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well."

Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.
Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.
In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well."

This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.
Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.
On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.
At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles."

While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.
It is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.
On the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.
In conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. This is because children are likely to gain valuable experience which they can only have when studying aboard."

Discuss both views.,"International sport events such as the Olympics and the World Cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held. While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides.
To begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices.
With the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled.
To conclude, the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks. Thus, the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in."

Discuss both views.,"Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.
International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.
In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development."

However, many would argue that such events are a waste of useful resources, which could otherwise be streamlined to more needed areas. Although I am of the opinion that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, in this essay I will discuss both viewpoints with the help of relevant examples.
To support my view, I would like to bring to attention the 2009 Olympics held in China, which brought individuals from all over the world. The funds collected from the event provided a massive boost to the economy of the country, a significant portion of which was utilised for the welfare of underprivileged children in the nation.
On the other hand, it is imperative to note that a majority of profits gained from these shows go to the upper classes. For example, the IPL tournaments held in India have seemingly benefitted the uber rich participating in the auctions, while simultaneously draining tax-payers of their money.
However, coming from a community where sports serves as a bonding activity, I would also like to elaborate on the non-economic benefits of these games. The Olympic Games, for instance, garner a mass crowd from various nations bringing a variety of individuals together. They act as a nidus for soothing political tensions and improve diplomatic relations in times of unrest.
While many may object to the violent nature of some sports such as boxing, and the impact they have on young minds, these activities also serve as a conversation starter and are likely to ignite a spark of interest for sports in many.

Discuss both views.,"The topic indicates the international sports events could bring beneficial for a country. There are several aspects to approve as below:
Firstly, international sports events could increase economical income and stimulate domestic consumption. An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs. Moreover, international sports events will attract many sponsors, both oversea and domestic. They might find the new financial opportunity to extend their further investments in host country. For example, 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia where attracted many thousands of tourists flooded into the country and created a huge sum profits.
Secondly, international sports events help to develop country's infrustructures and facilities. For example, in order to hold the 2008 BeiJing Olympic Game China built the nation stadium , nation swimming center and Olympic community so on. Furthermore, the first high speed train started to shuttle from Bei Jing to Tian Jin. In next two decades , more and more high speed trains shuttle in China. Thirdly, an international sports event will efficiently encourage the citizens devoted more passions and enthusiasms to participate in it. For example, Bei Jing is the host city to held the 2022 Winter Olympic Game, which encourage a lot of Chinese to learn and participate these winter sports, like snowboard, skating. Fourth, there is an opportunity to perform various cultures and histories of country to all visitors. Meanwhile, international sports events successfully held in a country that will enhance its international influence and the reputation in international stage.
Generally speaking, international sports events could bring various beneficial development, not only for country but also for individuals."

Though, there are positive's and negative's considering how humongous the money making business around sports has evolved , the postives outweighs the negatives, which is also my opinion .
Firstly, over the years number of people involving directly by playing a sport or indirectly by watching it has increased . This creates pressure in sports personal and the management to provide quality sports which itself is costly considering the prices of telecasting and the technological advances. Secondly, giving the sports personal proper financial aid ,boosts their performance ,as most of the athletes come from a humble background . Providing financial aid also helps them to buy quality sports gear . Thirdly , most people drop their ambition of taking sports due to poor payments than other sectors , so giving them salaries is quite hard for the sports management if there are no sponsors .
The business around sports has been everblooming, be it in the form of owning, sponsoring or betting. The companies, involve in sports industry with a motive of advertising their brands on large scale ,which otherwise ,is an unachievable task . The betting industry has been rising ,as it is highly lucrative considering the time and resources spent .
On the other hand , people also believed that too much of flow of money has created corruption in the sports sector . The example of DLF IPL scam by Lalit Modi supports the argument of such people , commonwealth scam is also one such. The people in betting are luring players with money and fixing matches for their monetary gains which is killing the spirit of the game.
In conclusion, I support that high earnings in sports industry has had a positive impact on the quality of sports played and also being delivered on televisions with such quality."

It presents not only the professional players and companies with high earnings, also gain reputations in their fields. From personal view, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. But, from professional players and companies, I think the phenomenon is a positive development.
At first, as an audience, a fan or a consumption, I have to pay more costs for watching sports events or purchasing sport commodities than before. For example, the sport shoes from Nike and Adidas have risen in their prices up year by year. Thus, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. Secondly, on the contract, as professional players, particularly some very famous athletes who have a lot of proponents and gain high reputations all over the world. They have the abilities to create wealth. Besides, they have profound influences and authorities which inspire more people to engage in the sport. For example, Lional Messi, a world-famous soccer player, and Roger Federe, an iconic tennis player. Both they have a lot of followers, some of them are willing to contribute their money and passions to these sports. Furthermore, as a sport company, which would like to invest more capital to research and develop the higher quality of productions. Like high-tech swimming suit , high-tech shoes and high-tech equipment, which not only help the players to create their better scores but also widely attract a lot of people since they are issued . General speaking, sport companies are the dominant sponsors in various sports events. For example, Nike and Adidas company who have strongly supporting many sports events to held annually. Those sports events attract immense audiences simultaneously offer more opportunities to sport players.
On a conclusion, even if the sports industry is gaining high earnings, whereas which stimulate the development of sport economy and inspire many people to focus on sports activities."

I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.
Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.
Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.
In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government."

Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of people’s competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually.
It is true that group activities potentially strengthen people’s social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster people’s communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other people’s progress.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life."

Both ones are important in teaching life skills. Below, we will see which one of them is a great way of teaching more important life skills.
First of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. In addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. However, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.
In fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. Firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. Second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.
In conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider. However, in my opinion, doing activities in group or as a team can teach more important life skills than those activities which are done alone because group activities let us explore the world around us which will later teach us important skills which are necessary for our survival."

This essay will argue why collaborating works against isolating ones are entirely necessary in gaining life abilities and competencies.
It is clear that People are usually different in their own characters and in their dealing with things. So that, some of them like to be alone and want to move on activities without sharing the others because they afraid of involving in troubles. They also think that the others may treat them jealously and enviously. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of aggressive states inside learning circuses which sometimes made losing knowledge rather than winning new abilities. Moreover, those people may have deep fears and shy which constantly prevent them from growing among team works. For example many famous celebrities had become more creative by sitting alone. Such those ideas let people do not want to change their acceptable way in getting and learning skills for authentic life against team activities. In contrast, grouping work can overcome all obstacles in personality and teach people different kinds of skills.
Although some people can success in learning all they need individually, most of them whether their age and background eagerly need contacting the others to teach them lessons about realistic life skills. Cooperating concept is important in teaching people manners for adapting through life. As previous researches of Vojytsky has declared that learners always could build knowledge while interactions directly or indirectly with others. Overall the idea of sharing activities in order to give persons opportunity to learn values and new skills is completely true despite the minor improving of lonely ones' life.
This essay argued that it is had better getting bit new skills in team or group work ,on the other hand its useless way to teach people activities alone. In my opinion, it is quite important and interesting way to let people contacting and teaching each other a plenty of skills in the same time.

Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,
and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.
Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people are
the most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.
Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.
Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive."

Although doing things alone is beneficial as it strengthens decision making skills, working in teams can educate more valuable life lessons as it teaches teamworking and negotiation skills necessary for living in a community.
Firstly, working in a group helps build teamworking skills. In a team, in order to be successful in doing peojects, members need to help one another in achieving mutual goals. Therefore, through these steps, team members will be trained on assisting others to reach the goal, although they may feel more competent undergoing a project on their own. Similarly, in real societies, people living in the same community cannot be careless to their neighbors and, instead, have to understand each other. Because of this understanding, they can tolerate one another.
Still, it can be argued that working collectively nurtures people to follow the crowd and hence, they cannot sharpen decision making skills. For this point, it is valid that a lone wolf has a clearer vision in its life direction than a pack of wolves that walk behind a leader. Still, a single leader may lead to a wrong path that ends up to a disaster for all other wolves. Thus, in order to make a right decision effectively, it is required that people work together since they can debate and negotiate what is appropriate for the team which, in turn, beneficial for each individual. Likewise, in a country, no single prime minister can dictate the country's direction. Nevertheless, opinions gathered from the parliament are necessary.
In conclusion, team projects are more useful in culminating skills crucial to live in a society. Teamworking skills gained from working together will lead to an understanding of other people not only in the team but in the same society. Moreover, people will be trained on negotiation and compromisation which yield better success than decisions done alone by a single person."

Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.
Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.
It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.
In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation."

Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic indicated that the family members no longer eat meals together in the modern society. The reason are complex and the phenomenon is inevitable.
I think the first factor is that the pressure from the modern age has increased. More and more family members busy on their jobs and studies. They undergo more pressures than ever have before. For example, a father who very busy at work, he usually work extra hours and social with his clients. His schedule is volatile thus he has to give up his time to eat meals with his family members. The second factor is that family members have their own schedules in the fast-moving world. Furthermore, the more social activities lead sophisticated to people's lifestyle. For example, a family member who goes to fitness center after work, he eat by individual instead eat meal together. The third factor is that the scale of family members has decreased, more and more family members left their hometown for the new place, like urban or big city. They cannot eat together due to geographical separation. Probably a family member eat meals by individual whom might feel lonely and insulated.
On conclusion, this social phenomenon is an evident of the changing society. Obviously, family member eat meal together that help them to reinforce their relationships each other and create a good communication among them. It would be a happiness moment when family members eating together. But the fact we have to accept is that the society is changing."

Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people argue that people less frequently gather around a table at meals with their family members, due to a number of factors such as changing trends in the living style and weakened relations between parents and children. I strongly believe that this has a devastating effect on the future of society.
Compared to half of a century ago, the habits of especially big-city dwellers have experienced a dramatic shift in recent years. While people get used to living in extended families, today they tend to live in smaller families called celullar families. In the following step, isolation became much more significant that children aged over 18 years prefer to move to a separate house. Additionally, even individuals who live with their family rarely share daily activities including eating meals, mainly related to different and busy working schedules. Apparently, the residents of the metropolis are reluctant to spend their time because of the increased incidence of depression or other psychologic disorders.
A growing body of evidence indicates that as people choose to do their activities alone, their family bonds are also negatively affected. As a physician, from my point of view, children who are raised in this environment are more likely to become antisocial and unsuccessful in both academic and social life. Furthermore, most of these young persons suffer from psychiatric disorders which are remarkably infrequent among people who keep in touch with their relatives. Also, these youngsters are more commonly committed crimes such as drug trafficking, robbery or, even murder.
In conclusion, quitting daily activities that are done together is the initial step of falling apart for family members which inevitably leads to worse outcomes for the society like increased risk of crime and psychiatric problems."

There are people who believe that physical strength is the key for success, on the contrary, others think that mental strength is most important for being successful. While muscle and physical preparation are the main reason to overcome on weaker opponents. Mental strength, in my perspective, is the most important because provides something special and unbreakable that last longer and gives more than just muscle power.
One the one hand, it is the physical strength. Which provides more energy for developing and performing better in sports, such as soccer, tennis, golf with better and precises strikes on the ball. Although, gives an important advantage on weaker opponents in therms of power, mobility and speed among others, for instance, boxing against a 20 pounds lighter fighter. In global, physical strength is a good and simple reason to overcome weaker athletes.
On the other hand, it is the phychological factor or “the head”. Which deliver more reciliense and will to win in stress and critic situations, like the final match in the last set of a grand slam. Also, good mental state allows to compensate the strengh, muscle and energy of opponents by focalizing the attention on last longer, that is the case of runners in marathon and ultramarathons. In the end, menthal power deliver something special, not measurable and unbreakable that last longer than just physical power.
In my opinion the most powerfull weapon that all athletes have is the mental strength, it is more powerful than any muscle, provides resilience to fatigue and focus in stressed times.
In summary, physical strength provides advantage on many aspects of sports, such as energy, velocity and movement. Nevertheless, mental strength is the key to succes in high quality sportsmans"

Hercules from Greek mythology and Samson from the Bible were known for their strength. Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods adorned winged sandals to grant him the speed of wind. From ancient to current times, champions have shared their skills via sports. But a question has arisen. What takes presedence, brain or brawn?
For those who believe that physical strength is important for success in sport, we must consider the effort put into performing said activities. Running a marathon is easier said than done! Raising over 500kg above your head doesn't happen overnight, or rowing in appealing synchronization without training. Athletes train in gyms for countless hours by running on treadmills, strength training and doing plyometrics to develop the power in order to effectively perform their respective sports, thus proving the importance of physical strength to prevail in sports.
Others believe that in order to distinguish between the average and the greats, mental strength is the factor that does so. The amount of discipline, perserverance and other psychological strengths allow athletes to set world records. Former world's strong man, Eddie Hall has stated that he had used techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of the brain that provide super strength similar to that people use in life threatening situations to lift cars to save their children. He was able to become the first man to deadlift over 500kg. Though not as extreme, sportsmen and women must apply some form of mental strength to push themselves to achieve record-level excellence in sports.
I believe that brain and brawn harmoniously work together to create exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength is the baseline that allows athletes to perform their skills with endurance, and mental strength is the value needed to push them to go one step ahead of their competition. Sportmen must be able to run, lift, or even row without issue, as well as try, try, and try again, working through limiting beliefs so that they can become apart of sporting history."

This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.
On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.
On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.
In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all."

This essay will discuss both these views with examples and show that while some people esteem physical strength, it is important to think of mental stretgth as a companion of physical strength which give any person in sports agility and flexibility.
Physical strength has been supported by many people as an important factor for success in sport. Those who think that physical strength is more important believe that it is a person's physique that is required to win any sport. For instance, in a study conducted by the Australisn National Team among sport fanatics in Perth, 80% of participants stated that physical strength was everything that any person involved in any kind of sport required to be succesful. Some participants in this study cited soccer as one such sport requiring physical strength. These findings were supported by another study conducted by a PhD student at the University of Sydney. The student concluded that while mental strength was important in any physically inclined sport, it was difficult to measure brain resources recquired to engage in sports like running.
On the other hand, some people think that mental strength gives stamina and agility to any person involved in sports. One prominent argument in this school of thought is that the body is a slave of the mind. Every action taken by the body is a response to the triggers initiated in the mind. Therefore, nourishing and strengthening mental capacity translates to physical strength. In a research study conducted among college students in America, it was found that mental strength was more esteemed than physical strength. It was argued in this study that mental strength was the breath that gave life to physical strength.
In conclusion, it can be argued that the reality of both mental and physical strength and their role in supporting a succesful sports career is not painted in black and white. A physically strong person needs to use their mental strength to plan and outwit their opponent. They also need tact and flexibility of the body which stem from the coordination between the body and the mind. As such, both mental and physical strength are important in supporting a successful sports career."

Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The use of social media nowadays is widespread around the world. As the use of new techonology grows, people concern about what will be impact of this change. Some people argue the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among people, which will lead to negative impacts on the society. Whereas, Others claim that the benefits from the use of social media outweigh the negative impacts. Which one is true? I will compare these two perspectives and state my opinion in this essay.
There is no denying that the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction to some extent. People use social media to connect with other people. This kind of behaviors decrease the aspiration of real life interaction. However, using social media can not give the same feeling as a face-to-face interation. There is lack of intimacy and empathy. For this reason, it is easy to fall in lonelyness while occupied in social media.
However, sometimes the use of social media assists the interactions in real life. For example, friends who are far away from each other can interact in social medias. This helps to keep their relationship which can lead to a face-to-face interaction in the future. Moreover, some people even find out their lover through social medias.
In my opinion, the argument that the use of social media will replace face-to-face interaction is a little bit exaggerated. After all, most people use social media to assist their real life relationship, not to completely replace their face-to-face interactions with online chattings. The use of social media might replace some portion of face-to-face interaction, but in most cases, it will help us to connect with other people, and promote our real life interactions."

Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.
As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.
If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.
One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.
I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time."

This means that those who are interested in improving their language skill or other specific hobbies. Furthermore, people are able to have a consultation with people around the world about their conserns of their lifestyle and mental issues that used to be confidential to their family, or friends face-to-face.

This social media is much helpful to work regardless of time, and place so that people can work with other country's colleagues. This is more profitable to make a sales figure smoothly because they can make more strategies because of these tools.
On the other hand, there might be some disadvantages. For instance, some people warn that people tend to be deluded because of innumerable information on social media. This means that they face some fake news and fraud. In addition, people would like to spend with friends, family, and strangers in person as a human instinct. Therefore, it necessarily recoups their lonliness by taking advantage of social media because they unconsciously hope to spend a good time in person, more than in blind conversation.

What are the solutions to make people drink less.,"Sugar-based drinks has become a popular beverage amongst the people especially in today's generation, the millenials. This essay will outline possible reasons on why people are consuming such drinks and also some ways for them to consume less.
To start, sugar is the main component of this beverage. Study shows that consuming this can boost a person's energy levels. Hence athelete ae addicted to this refreshments such as energy drinks. Furthermore, this can increase mental alertness especially to working individuals. For instance, not all workers has the capability to maintain their energy at work, sometimes they tend to get sleepy leading them to buy sugary drinks like milk teas. Not only that, advertisement can also be a factor. For example, young people gets curious whenever new sugared drinks is advertised especially if this is shown by their favorite icon. Lastly, consumer's lack of knowledge and misinformation regarding their product as evident by the coca cola lawsuit.
Although it may be difficut for people to stay away from this. There are ways that can help them drink less. One solution is for government to impose a price hike. Meaning high price can discourage them to buy this drinks. Second, just like alcohol, buying sugar-based drinks at malls or grocery store should have time limit. For instance, whoever will buy and sell beyond the allotted time should pay a fine. Also, Educating the public about the health issue of drinking too much sugar-based drinks should be prioritize. Finally, government should encourage company such as pepsiCo, and the Coca-cola company to be transparent of their nutritional facts.
In conclusion, sugar-based drinks has become popular due to advertisements and society's thinking that it can replenish their energy levels. In contrast, goverment should take the first step educate and encourage individuals to mimimize drinking this."

The flavour can be accepted by many persons.The main ingredients of the drink are sugar and juice.It is not bitter,in the contrary,that is sweet which can make people pleased.For instance,the extent of sweet depends on the sugar and more sugar can make the flavor better.Thus many people follow the high sugar drink.
In addition,price is a factor we can't ignore.The price of drink is affordable for most of consumers.Meanwhile,the stress of work is overwhelming,they are necessary to supply the power,youths in particular.The two phenomenons are common in daily life.
It is obvious that is harmful to health if having the sugar based drinks frequently.We can solve the problem in 2 ways.First of all,Government should undertake the responsibility, which is advertising the harm to drink high -sugar juice over-dose.Moreover,goverment can limit the number of drinks that are purchased by consumers.In addition,individual attention is necessary as we can avoid drinking bubble tea.Taking exercise regularly is beneficial to consume the sugar.Paying attention to the health is needful for people.
In conclusion,high-sugar dirink can give people happiness.Similarly it demages body if drinking too much,so goverment make efforts to solve the problems.We should limit the extent similarly,I hold the opinion that drink is going to less and less if taking measures."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that individuals can't do nothing to resolve the environmental problems of our times. Personaly, I partially disagree with this statement and in this essay I will go through some of the arguments that back my opinion.
On one hand, I have to agree with this statement. Many of the environmental problems that we are currently facing are caused by large companies and not by individuals. Whether it's pollution, deforestation or contamination, the indivual doesn't have as much impact as these entities have. Therefore, governements should take care of the problem rather than passing into the current citizen. In addition, the solutions that are needed to take place require an important political and economical influence. Only the governments are available to put in place the measures needed to counter-balance this situation.
On the other hand, waiting to be saved by the governments and institutions is not the right attitude. Individuals, while not having the same impact, can spark the change that is needed in order to take care of this problem. Not only that but citizens can make their contribution by applying some small measures than by itselfs aren't noticeable but when summed up can have a positive impact. For example, recycling their food waste or using ecological friendly products are habits that we can all do. If only one person does it, it won't have any effect, but it does when it's done by one million,
In conclusion, it can be said that both sides are needed in order to make a positive change on the current situation. This can start from the individual to then put in motion a bigger change."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Individuals, who are willing to develop the environment are quite limited. Some people say it is almost nothing they can do. Therefore, governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society. I strongly disagree this opinion, because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent.
Initially, there is no doubt that governments, large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment. For example, in Europe, especially in Germany, they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future. Therefore, even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity, which is a sustainable resource. Therefore, governments and companies control peoples' lifestyle.
On the other hand, people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line. Therefore, many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside. They also purchase sustainable bottles, instead of tapping into plastic bottles. In addition, technology has advanced in a few decades, and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment. This means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events. For example, they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism, and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle. As a result, some people start to establish a company geared towards eco-friendly company. For example, some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource.
Finally, of course, large companies and governments have a large power to control
the environment more beautifully. On the other hand, these organizations also configured by individuals. Therefore, governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school. Consequently, more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization, the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually. If the ideas were rejected, they can post these ideas on the internet and people will come together to make a specific project.
In conclusion, individuals can do a lot of options by taking advantage of the internet and the influences are getting larger."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.
In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.
Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.
Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation."

While people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs, there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better. In this essay, I try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation.
The first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve. One of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality. Since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual, their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other. For instance, some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market, while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future. Another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements. A prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation. Although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against, this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day.
Despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone, there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live. In my opinion, an ideal society includes at least great tolerance. I believe that education, especially in primary school and kindergarten, plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect, which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly. One measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school, which publicize and advocate the value of fairness, justice, and kindness.
To sum up, although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society, there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all."

Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.
An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.
However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.
To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one."

Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.
To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one."

Although striving for these ideals would benefit the individuals, I strongly believe that an ideal society can never be achieved because it’s unrealistic.
Striving for an ideal society would benefit the individuals because nobody can live better unless they learn to think better. To begin with, virtues such as courage, fairness, and respect are admirable character traits that everyone should try to pursue. If individuals can become better versions of themselves, then the whole community would surely become better. Moreover, different people will have different versions of an ideal society. Hence, encouraging people to actively and critically think about how they can lead better lives will lead to a more open-minded, robust, and tolerant community.
While it’s beneficial for individuals to work on self-improvement, an ideal society can never be created or maintained. Firstly, people are selfish and will pursue their self-interest at the expense of the group. If I can get ahead by taking more resources than my neighbor, then why shouldn’t I take more? Upon seeing me do that, others will envy and start taking more for themselves. Consequently, competition and discord within society are inevitable. Secondly, progress can’t be made unless stronger groups get ahead and wipe out less adaptable ones. Examples include factories replacing farming cultures and technology replacing manual labor.
In conclusion, although striving towards the ideals is beneficial to individuals within communities, the ideal society could never be achieved due to its impracticality. Schools, governments, and communities should nevertheless encourage people to actively think and work on becoming better versions of themselves."

In this essay, I will give my point of view of an ideal society and after I will explain the methods to create this society.
To begin with, from my experience and perspective, I believe that the ideal society is a place without criminals and serious offenders. A community without crime is a wonderful and safe place for our children and our families to live in harmony without rapes, thefts and murders. For example, in an isolated village outside a theme park in Canada, the locals lived with rules and culture without violence and crimes and everybody was happy and satisfied with their jobs and social life. Furthermore, the local community was very well balanced without arguments and conflicts because of the lack of serious offenders and criminals.
On the other hand, the creation of an ideal society is something very difficult. I honestly believe that the only way to build a balanced community is to educate our children because they are the future of this world and they need good examples and knowledge to create a good character. For instance in Ancient Athens, Greece local politicians and philosophers were responsible to educate the young people not only in school but also in the street or open theatres. As a result of this action, young people received knowledge and fundamentals to be ideal citizens of ancients Athens.
To conclude, from my point of view there is no place for crimes and offences in an ideal society because these will destroy the balance and the harmony of the people. Furthermore, proper education is the best way to help our children to build good characters and balanced lifestyles."

Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The topic of whether students should choose a specific specialized in limited subjects or all students need to study a wide range of subjects until they graduate school, has been discussed across the world, including in Japan. Although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject, I think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school.
For example, there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in Japan. Specifically, it is geared toward hair stylists, IT programming, and entertainment. It is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques. Especially, when it comes to entertainment, younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to learn a variety of subjects until they leave high school. For example, learning mathematics will allow us to boost some skills to predict and solve some issues logically. And learning English will be an essential tool to communicate with people worldwide. In addition, people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation, especially in the workplace. This means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds.
Finally, it might be difficult for teenagers, especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation, and industry they would like to work. Teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them, however, they have some specific dreams in advance. Therefore, learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future. This means that if students had learned a wide range of subjects until high school, it will be helpful to consider a long time and let them decide on a variety of job occupations. Then, they should choose the specific faculty they would like to learn at university."

What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.
On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.
On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.
To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents."

What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The is a common belief that students’ focus on selected subjects from secondary school is beneficial for their school results. However, it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future.
On the one hand, studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities. Once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art, science, or commerce, they will be focused on special training. This teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals. For instance, in China, over 500 business schools are opened to train students to become specialists in the business field. Students can apply to those schools when they turn 15. According to a statistic from one of the business schools, 70% of their students received high scores in the national exam.
Nevertheless, a wide range of subjects is more suitable for students to develop their intelligence. Students can student various knowledge from different aspects, they can choose the subject they are interested in most. Moreover, students can have a longer time to study before choosing their faculty at university. Numbers of basic knowledge and longer time to consider helping them make the best decision for themself. Students are motivated to do their best. For example, over 90% of students at the Norway University claimed that they are satisfied with studying all subjects before choosing a university. They have a full idea of what they like and dislike. They found that school life is excited and full of happiness.
To sum up, it is apparent that students can be well-developed in a specific subject with a limited range of choices, however, it is undeniable that a wide range of subject can develop their real interests."

Some experts believe that it is good for pupil to only focus on a few subjects during their school life. However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.
First of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.
Conversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while. That is why parents sometimes enjoy to choose various of study tours as well as extra curriculums for their children. Thus, some people tend to having more immersing the experience more than studying a few of subjects in their young age.
In summarize, it is hard to say which opinion would be the best since different types of education methods may have their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, personally, it is the key that pupils will never know what they can done until they tried. That is the reason why I prefer studying vary subjects in their young age than being an expert in the major part."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.
With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?
There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.
Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.
In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future."

Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"Councils are debating if building housing areas on expanded land is a better solution than providing taller dwellings. It might be an extremely complicated choice, considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk-distance city. This essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout.
Although the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for, under a generic point of view, it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land. The first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking, public transport or eco-friendly vehicles. Moreover, taking in account the overall incresing of population's density, with the creation of a taller layout, a sustainable market demand will be shown.
Nowadays, the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible. In most locations, cities are running out of vacant lands, in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family, when a building can be erected accomodating many households. Furthermore, an implementation in infrustracture, such as roads and parking, will be needed. If individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car, due to long distances to cover, more highway will be required, therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices.
To conclude, the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas, so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout, like skyscrapers rather than single houses, to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens' footprint."

Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.
Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.
In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.
Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.
In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now."

But I think the first solution which is, create housing areas by providing taller buildings, is a better solution. Providing taller buildings can save the area of lands being use and can create more areas with green grass or trees that can help the environment. Also taller buildings can provide greater view and can be designed in creative ways. So does the buildings in cities can create a skyline which makes the city scenario more modern and breathtaking. On the other hand, if we choose to build houses on a wider area, the land will still, be eventually out of use. And they are likely to destroy wildlife or nature areas since places that has wide areas are mostly at the rural parts of the country. Also, houses wide spread in a large area can be crowded and can seem messy and not ideal for site. Although maybe some people will think that shorter buildings are safer when there is a fire or when natural disasters like earthquake comes, but the number of times these problems occur are low and modern technology can also help to lower the risk of people getting hurt. In conclusion, I think create housing areas by providing taller buildings is a better solution because it solves the fundamental problem which is not having enough places for people to live by not using new lands and can also creates less harm for the nature, which is significantly important."

What solution is better?,"In the modern society,it is seen that the buildings in the housing areas vary from one city to the other city where some cities prefer taller buildings and other cities prefer smaller buildings on a wide land.
This essay illustrates the reason why they are built in this way and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of building.
It is often said that the taller buildings are ideal for houses in metropolitan cities.The main reasons are the cost of land and a very large population in big cities.As a solution for this problem,people in big cities prefer taller buildings where the homes are easily affordable for them.However,this leads to over crowding and lack of adequate ventilation.For instance,in Mumbai,the largest city in India,the cost of land and the population is so high that the majority of the constuction companies build taller buildings in order to solve this problem.
In contrast,some cities with a lower population and comparatively lower cost of land build shorter buildings on a wide land.This enables cities to prevent over crowding in communities and have a wider open area with greenery providing a lot of ventilation helping people to lead a better life style.For example,in Chandigarh,a union territory in India,the construction of houses are perfectly executed providing enough space between each house as the cost of land and the population is relatively low when compared to cities like Mumbai.
To summarise,some cities with high cost of land and the high population prefer taller buildings lacking adequate ventilation and leading to overcrowding where as the in the cities with the opposite situation ,the houses are built on a larger piece of land providing adequate space between each house."

It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.
First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.
Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.
But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.
In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works."

It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is becoming a trend now that husbands and wives should handle the household works together since both members of the family are working full time. In my opinion, it is convincing that the house tasks should be equally spread between both genders for the following reasons.
In many developing countries, people are required to work more than before; as a result, both genders are having busy lives nowadays and cannot handle the works of the house by only one of them. If the chores are being handled by both men and women, it increases the other partner's satisfaction and shows responsibilty. For instance, if a wife has several tasks in the kitchen to finish before heading to work and her husband helped their children to get ready for school, this emotionally affects the wife and she will eventually feel gratification.
Secondly, as technology evolves, people are having a hard time to manage the tasks of their homes and might eventually hire a nanny to take care of the children and home. As a result, children would feel loneliness in addition to being ignored by their parents. Although it is not easy to manage the work life and family at the same time, giving priority to one before the other can be counter-productive. Finally, as both partners work together to handle household work, it will eventually lead to a balanced life, their daily schedules will be organised; moreover, they will have more time to spend with their children thus, the home will not have problems as long as the mother and the father are working together to manage their home.

It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that in several nations Ladies and Gentlemen should help each other in domestic duties owned to the fact that both are fully employed. Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other. This essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments.
There are manifold reasons for home activities division. First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.
Other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their husbands. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.
In conclusion, couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations. Therefore, I strongly agree with the stand that both can do the dishes without any hesitation. Furthermore, they should make a week blueprint to the best duties management."

It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In many parts of the world, both men and women are full-time employees, which has led to the trend of shared household chores for both genders. In my opinion, this shift should be encouraged to reduce inequality issues while it also benefits family relationship.
First, sharing housework is reasonable because it will enhance gender equality, which is a worrying problem in many societies. In the past, it was widely believed that women were solely responsible for household works since women have the distinctive characteristics of care and neatness. This has resulted in many women in many countries, particularly in Asia, under pressure and engendering a sense of resentment regarding overwhelming housework. If such jobs are shared to men, it is highly that such burdens are minimised, thus being treated more fairly.
Another compelling reason for having both males and females engaging in doing household chores is the reduction in a family dispute. If such duties are mainly done by only men or women, the other tends to feel overwhelmed, which might, in turn, lead to domestic argument and violence. A clear explanation is a higher rate of divorce in America, which is caused by the unnecessary argument made by young adult couples.
In conclusion, while more men and women seem to work full-time nowadays, it is advisable that they both should take responsibility for doing housework. I agree with this as believe that It is fair and will help minimise arguments among family members, leading to an equality society and a healthy family unit."

Is it positive or negative development,"Striving for own career development is most of the people's lifetime target in the modern city. In some nations, employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon. This essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and I reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees.
There are two main reasons behind this phenomenon. Firstly, it could be the corporate culture of the company. The management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance. For instance, employees in Japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours. This forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss.
Secondly, as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous, coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance. It causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements. For example, product sales agents' performance depends on the sales number quarterly. If the agent cannot sale the products effectively, they will receive less revenues or even being sacked.
As per the reasons stated, I absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies. It is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health. Inversely, it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company. Work-life balance is important to everyone as suitable relaxing time can considerably enhance the performance of human."

Is it positive or negative development,"Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.
It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.
With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life."

Is it positive or negative development,"In some countries, including Japan, people tend to spend long hours at work. In recent years, this issue is often discussed around Japan. Although some Japanese people take it positively, I strongly oppose this idea and believe it is no longer positive development now. I would like to state some reasons with some examples in Japanese society.
Firstly, the Japanese economy used to be the worst poverty country around the world after world war two. Many buildings and companies were devastated, therefore, Japanese people stucked together on how to recover the damage and improve their economy. As a result, the Japanese economy has drastically and steadily developed. As a result, the Japanese economy was about to be the wealthiest country by 1980. In these periods from 1950 to 1990, the longer people work, the more money returned to employees. In addition, it was traditionally believed for Japanese people that it is virtue to work long hours in Japanese society.
But the economic bubble suddenly exploded in 1992, Japanese economy suddenly declined and economic growth still remains the same in 2022. Sadly, working long hours is not necessarily connected to companies profit. Although it is because of economic recession, companies still believed that it is important to work hours will result in increase company's profit. As a result, some people became workaholics and the number of people who are suffering from mental depression. Currently, Japan is one of the highest suicide rates in developed countries.
Finally, in my opinion, the most important point is how productive systems companies and organizations need to create. For example, many companies tend to rely on too much tasks for employees who have better skills or positions than other employees. Therefore, they need to provide some curriculums about specific skills in IT, language, and accountant. If each employee upskilled their ability, it would be able to divide and conquer the tasks more efficiently. In addition, it must be more effective to adopt intern-ship work opportunities for university students. This means that those who already have work experience beforehand will cause to reduce their training time.
In conclusion, Japanese society is suffering from depopulation, too. This means that Japanese people are required to work with less volume workforce. Therefore, companies and the government need to consider how to work efficiently and reduce too much tasks in one employee. I believe Japanese people will be able to resolve this problem, because they are so diligent and made many success to make a countermeasure by a long history."

Is it positive or negative development,"It is often the arguement and debate of the main reasons for why employees spend longer hours at their jobs and what are the consequences of it. This essay will argue this statement, provide top reasons and main outcomes of doing so and give some relevant examples.
There are several reasons why workers tend to spend too much time at their jobs, beyond the work hours stated in the contracts. One reason could be that those employees have recently joined the company and they want to leave a good impression on their supervisors during the three-month probation period. Another factor is related to the many various tasks and projects given all at once, hence they get stressed out as they're restricted with the deadlines. On the other hand, some are just staying at work for a prolonged period is for the sake of self-development, e.g. studying for some certification programs, online master degree, etc.
When it comes to the consequences, it can be either positive or negative, depending on the reason itself. If it is self-development then it is a good thing. In contrast, if this keeps repeating everyday then it is unhealthy for both the body and the mentality. Also, it can affect the social life and a marriage relationship. As an illustration, some countries (such as Dubai) have reduced the work hours and the outcome of this study was found satisfactory, i.g. the employees have become more productive, fruitful, and the quality of their inputs drastically improved.
To sum up, the best and optimal choice is to balance between the social life and the time spent at work. If we constantly adopt such habit this will affect our health (physically and mentally) and as a result the contribution and performance will deteriorate and the required job won't be done at a satisfactory level."

Is it positive or negative development,"In recent times as technology progresses, majority of people have spent longer time at work for many reasons which can be caused by a high work demands and people need to cope with their daily living. This development would have negative connotations, if people would not have a work-life balance and gradually affect their health.
Numerous workers have sometimes oblige to stay at work longer. Firstly, there are huge companies that need more workforce and time to keep up with work requirements. As an individual worker, sometimes requires to extend their work hours to finish the workload and assigned tasks. In most shipping companies or factories in the Philippines, for instance, there often have an outrageous number of workload to be done therefore multitude employees have been tied up to work and forced to render overtime. Secondly, nowadays people are facing in large of debts and bills. In Canada, the cost of living is quite high and unaffordable for some, so that several people work double jobs or often do overtime to earn extra more.
Spending too much hours working has two possible drawbacks, an absence or lack of work-life balance and acquiring diseases in the long run. For married people, family time is significantly valuable in order to maintain a good family bond. Workaholic people have the tendency to negelct the importance of family bonding and tend to experience health problems thereafter. According to one research in the US, found that the number of workaholic people was tripled from 10 million to about 30 million in over a decade and majority of these people suffered from stress- related diseases such as depression, heart disease and chronic back pain.
To conclude, most people have spent longer time working due to extreme work demands and personal financial challenges. Although this gives some benefits to oneself or companies, it can turn one's life into unhappy and unhealthy life."

There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways. In contrast, it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration. Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment.
Initially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood.
People do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket.
On the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries.
Finally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair. Therefore, the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent."

In addition, the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world. Some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter. While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways. However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.
On one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.
On the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. For instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view I strongly believe that space companies such as SpaceX must try to find a new resources to visit other planets. However, I agree that they should be done after providing the basic needs of the human on earth and investing to solve poverty and any other human tragedies."

Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.
Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.
Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.
In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible."

However, rapid evolution of technologies and the fast consumption of natural resources are also major concerns for many scientists in today's world. Some people believe that more money spent on space exploration is inevitable for fulfulling the demands of scientific discovery and the future development of human technologies; however, many others argue that this money should be invested in other more useful places where more human lives can be improved.
Space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over the recent years. Scientists have long been searching for possible ways to contact the unknown lives outside this planet and unwrap the secrets of the universe such as the black holes and the birth of the space. The more advanced human-technologies become, the further an austronaut can travel to. Scientists believe that space discoveries can help human beings to develop new technologies and find new resources outside our solar system. However, the evolutions of technologies and equipments always require huge investments.
In fact, space exploration can be both benefitial and time-consuming. If such a scientific project is carried and supervised by a rich nation, greater success can be seen. However, there are many other pre-existing problems on the other side of this planet that require attention and aids, such as hunger and proverty. In this case, I think these issues should be prioritized because every human life is precious. If those people's lives are taken care off, there should be less worries on scientific research as well.
In conclusion, space exploration can be benefitial for the evolution of human technologies and possible findings of new resources. However, they should be done after fulfilling the basic needs other people on the other side of this planet."

To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some governments budget a considerable amount of expenditure on space exaploration, yet many opponents voice their opinion that it is meaningless to financially support this aspect, and this money should be alternatively allotted on other more important priorities. My firm conviction is that it is rewarding to pour money into exploring outer space since it might produce long-term benefits.
From a short-term pespective, there are seemingly compelling reasons to exclude space exploration from the national budget. The result of exploring the exterrestrial space is unpredictable. If research fails, it would be a loss of financial resources considering the huge cost. Besides, compared with space exploration, education inequality, health care problems and underdeveloped infrastuctures are more urgent issues, meaning that money spent on these facets may produce immediate benefits for people's quality of life.
However, I firmly believe we should hold a long-term perspective and figure out potential merits brought about by exploring and researching the outer space. First of all, environmental problems, such as global warming and water shortage, are gradually worsening and threatening people's health to a large extent. Allocating financial resources on space exploration could further investigate and prove whether there are life forms or natural resources on another planet, which might provide a soultion to those long-exisiting environmental issues. Also, many exisiting technologies closely associated with the daily life of mainkind, such as weather forcast and earthquake anticipation, are also highly reliant on the space technology. This will allow humans to take necessary precautions in the face of some urgent situations.
To summarize, I believe space exploration is a long-term solution to many existing problems on this planet, and thus deserve adaquate government expenditure."

The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.
Planet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.
Space exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.
Since the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.
Lastly, the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit, in my opinion. Humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe.
In conclusion, it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued. But the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings."

Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,"Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.
Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.
Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.
Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food."

Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"It is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society, which affects in various aspects. Hence, there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate. Nevertheless, there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which I personally agree with.
It is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience. A criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom. This is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only, meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term. Another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time. Living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy, which is the experience that people tend to avoid.
In spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective, other solutions could also be applied. A classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments. Since people do not want to lose their money, this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws, leading to the declining number of crime. Another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime. Once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors' safety, they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term.
In conclusion, despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life, it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective. This is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run."

Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"The topic of whether giving longer prison sentences lead to a decrease in the rate of crime or some other alternative solutions might be helpful to reduce the rate of crime. Although it depends on each country's crime rate and cost, I believe some alternative solutions will be realistic for reducing crime.
First of all, some people believe giving a long sentence will be not only a safe solution, but also useful to pay an attention to other people not to commit a crime. They state that this is the best way in terms of cost, and the organization well systemized. They believe the crime rate will go down as a result.
On the other hand, some people oppose the system. The longer prison sentences have an influence to some extent. But for the victims and their families can not be convinced, and if alternative systems are well organized, some crimes might be prevented in advance. Therefore, it must be necessary to deploy the military or police in a specific area where crimes often occur. This is effective to inhibit the crime rate.
Finally, crimes, criminals often sporadically emerge, even if the government stipulates the law which serves long prison sentences. This is ubiquitous around the world. Therefore, the most important point is how people need to become aware of dangerous situations and avoid not being involved. In addition, governments need to delegate stronger authority to the police and military to patrol around the specific area twenty-four seven, as comparatively higher crimes occur in the town. This might be costly, but it is worthwhile to configure a safe society."

I believe, that the judicial system should look for other ways to punish criminals depending on the severity of the offence.
Firstly, by keeping people encarcelated for years, 'the problem is locked up' and there is no need to dealt with it until the sentence is served. For instance, for individuals who have committed a serious crime such as murder, a long sentence is appropriate due to the severity of it and the criminal's possible danger for the society. On the contrary, for little criminals, like robbery, mild sentences or social hours should be considered as an option.
On the other hand, by trying to get these individuals before they commit a severe crime, could be a clever step. For example, in Switzerland, social workers work very hard to get, mostly youngster, an apprenticeship. So, they are kept busy and usually happy. By placing people to jail for a long time, they loose the contact to the outside world. Therefore, trying to keep them outside doing the activities they were doing before the crime, would be a reasonable. In other words, these citizens could wear electronically sensors, so that the judicial services can check on them. That would be a win-win situation for the government, society due to the lower cost compared to the jail expenses and for the individual who can continuing with his/her life.
In brief, despite some circumstances for jailing an individual, I believe, that alternative ways of punishment should always be on option depending on the degree of the crime."

It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.
However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.
First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.
For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.
As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021."

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With new technologies come new ways to communicate with people. First, we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another. And this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life. This topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that, so in this essay, I'm gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication.
First, I would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work. In my opinion, the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it's more convenient. We don't have to set a specific date to meet someone. And also we can talk to someone from wherever we want, without needing to drive to the office. The two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection. But I think nowadays it won't be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff.
The second advantage - the functionality of apps for online communication. Let's take Zoom. I think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world, including myself. You can arrange a meeting with thousands of people, using this app. This is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place. You can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details. Face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities.
If we talk about disadvantages, I do not see a lot of them. The only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions. I find it really important, especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals. From my own experience, I can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic, I missed physical interaction with my colleagues, such as handshaking, etc. I find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building, so it's might be hard to work without it, using only online communication.
To conclude, I would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it's better to meet online or face to face. But what I am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely. Otherwise, It will be hard to keep the team tigh-knit."

In this essay, I will count the possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such an invention and finally conclude wether or not it is really a cost-effective one.
Over the course of modern history, national and international conferrences have cost enormous funds in order to gather experts from all over the world. However, thanks to the available online communication platforms, present companies and foundations can hold meetings with famous and influencial persons more often and with less expense. Furthermore, nowadays, employees can spare the time spent on travelling between offices and premises, by having online meetings. Meetings are now recorded for documentation and any future purposes. For example, this technology has seemd to be critical on our life, specifcally since the outbreak of COVID19. If humans had not have this means of communication, there would have been more severe and devastating effects on businesses.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits further consideration. Unfortunately, techincal network problems could still happen and cause inevitable cancellations. Moreover, meeting other colleagues merely on screens would have a detrimental social impact in workplaces. Without face-to-face interaction peers have less chance to build strong and deep relationships, which in turn might weaken co-opeartion and cohesion in any work environment.

We stiil sit at home rather then go to a restorant with friends and a lot of companies still keep their offices locked.
On the one hand office workers from all over the world opened the possibility of working from home. This option gives you more freedom and diversity of places from wich you can do your job: you can meet with your collegues from cafe or library, from kitchen or bedroom. Also, we were forced to keep our social nets with online tools, to communicate with our friends and families. Now we all learned to use such programmes like Zoom or Skype to speak with each other. Probably if we hadn't the Covid, we would struggle bigger difficulties when someone from our buddies would come to another country or town, but now we all know what to do with this, how to keep in touch. We also got to appreciate the power of touching more then before, because we were missing it for these long monthes. How it was nice to hug an old friend after long quarantine!
On the other hand we really weaned from normal offline communication. And we can't evaluate how many people started to think that online is absolute substitute of offline. It's obviosly not like that. During online meeting it's impossible to have a normal common discussion because it needs to have only one person speaking. Also people lack of possibility to see each others eyes, so they don't feel enough contact with each other.
As a conclusion it is possible to say that situation with increasing popularuty of online meetings is ambivalent. This type of communication save our connections with each other during the pandemia, but there is a risk of substitution real meetings by online in the situations when it is not appropriate. As far I am concerned, I think that advantages outweight disadvantages, but we need to use online communication properly."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Education is one of the most important topics for childhood development, and music can be very beneficial to children because it helps to sustain creative thinking and improve imagination. Some educators demand that music should be taught as a mandatory subject, and yet some others think that forcing children to play music instruments will limit their chances to discover and develop other talents.
Indeed, music can be a great source for improving the lives of many children as well as their learning experience. Learning music instruments requires patience, creativity and good discipline. Inherently, in order to master a music instrument, a good musician needs to sharpen his preserverence and offer all his best, for a great performance often demands ten or more years of practice. The heart of a musician, the pursuation of perfection and persistence are all good qualities for a child to learn throughout his life in pursuing his career, not only the career in music.
However, despite all the good qualities that can be obtained through playing music instruments, childhood education can be misdirected if the development of a hobbie becomes ""mandatory"", which, of ocurse, includes music instruments. It might be beneficial for a child to experiment music instruments in his early years, but not every child has the potential of being a professional musician. Making music a mandatory subject for primary and secondary school students could minimize their opportunities to discover different hobbies. Moreover, making a bobbie a mandatory subject may also hinder the other learning experiences of a young child. Just imagine how stressful it is to study an unecessary subject on top of regular courses and other homework. It does more harms than goods to the overall learning experience.
In conclusion, it might be beneficial for a child to learn music instruments in his first school years, but if he does not have the talent and does not enjoy music, educators should consider dropping such suggestion and let him discover other hobbies."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.
First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.
Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.
What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.
To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody."

Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.
On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.
On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.
In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school.

Some people hold that the pre-school life is the most influential, while others disagree and claim that the teenage life, notably the period of staying at school, would be more important to his/her life. This essay is to evaluate both views and demonstrate my opinion.
Before entering the school, children usually receive the most influence from their parents and friends. At home, children would spend much time with their parents teaching them a variety of knowledge needed to help an adolescent act properly and get recognised by the society in the future. When staying outside, children would also be influenced by their friends or other peers since children tend to resemble the behaviours of their peers in order to integrate into the social group of adolescents.
In the school life, a child's personality would be shaped both by classmates who frequently interact with the child and potentially affect the child, and by teachers presenting knowledge in various fields of science and liberal arts so as to help the child obtain a basic understanding to the world.
As far as I am concerned, it is rather arbitrary to conclude which period of life would be more important than the other, since a child's psychological development is too complex to be understood. After all, the importance of pre-school life or teenage period might vary from one child to another. Children have their respective understandings as to which person deserves their admiration and which period of life teaches them the best lesson.
To sum up, children would be influenced by different persons in different periods of life. It depends on children's own intention as to which period is more pivotal, and which person should be admired."

In contrary many said that experiences occurred during teenage perod ้have much more impact to their future. In this essay will disscuss on both point of view and will show some supportive opinions that experiences during the time at school are highly impact futher development in the future for many teenagers.
On one hand, it is the fact that experiences or events happend during their childhood or before they starting to go to school can highly attached to their memories. For example, children would be able to remember the situation where they felt the most insecure or scared, for example, some scary movies or fear of some animals. In which will be further more becomes their wound in their heart. However, these experiences can be erradicated or overcame after in their life and left with just some funny moments for them in the future. Also some of these memories might be erased from their thought since the events appeared during the first recent year of their life could be easily forgettable.
On the other hand, there are higher varieties of experiences occurred during teenage stage of life, in which are more recognizable both from an external factors like their friends, family or their environments in school. And also from their individuals experiences, for example, teenagers are able to realize some of the failure or mistakes that happened in their life such as their examinations failure. In addition to that, some of events might able to happend during the teenages time only, for example, their first love or their first boyfriend/girlfriend. Incorporate all these experiences which can in turn influence their future decision making and their development path in their life.

Some people argue that those experiences which a child faces before entering into school has more effect, whereas others believe that teenhood has profound influence on a child's future life. This essay will discuss in detail both the views and explain why i believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences decide what future holds for the child.
Those people, who are in opinion that experiences in early childhood before the start of school has impact on future life, give several reasons. They believe that whatever a child faces at home helps in shaping his personality. For example, abusive childhood greatly has long lasting effect on their lives. It has been studied that those children who are victims of child abuse are more likely to become criminals. Some of them can never return towards normal life. Moreover, parents by their care and love can raise a child with a bright future. These children know the world from the perspective of their parents and it helps them to become a well-mannered and cultured human being with specific life goals, such as getting higher education or finding a job. In short, early childhood has its far reaching effects on a child.
On the other hand, people, who think that teenage experiences , especially at school, have more impact on determining the future of the person, have their own reasons to support their argument. Firstly, it is the phase of life where hormonal changes are taking place and they are experiencing body changes both mentally and physically; therefore, those who can have control on their emotions during this phase can develop as a strong individual. Secondly, it is the phase where most of the teenagers start taking decisions about their future study choices and any study experience at school help them in making these decisions. Such resolutions in teenage can have impact on their future practical lives. Finally, those youngsters, who are bullied during their teenhood at school, can suffer from personality disorder later in their lives which can have detrimental affect on their future. Surely, these experiences in teenage can affect a child's future.
To conclude, i believe that both pre-school childhood and teenage experiences help shape the future of a person. It is the experiences in both of these phases of lives which influence a child's future."

Growing vegetables and taking care of animals are two main practices children should develop at their younger age. In this essay I will discuss some disadvatages that would affect children during this process and explain why I feel that there are better advatages.
The most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables. In this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables. It is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older. Taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary , this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals. Furthermore, they will learn to respect animals and love them.
Some of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick. However, some animals tend to be more dangerous than others. Another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well. Insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick.
In conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older. Eventhough, some argue that it is more riskier for children I believe that the advatages outweight disadvatages."

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In primary school, especially in the countryside in Japan, primary students have an opportunity to learn how to plant and grow vegetables. In addition, students need to feed and observe animal growth and health. This is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society. It is obviously advantageous than disadvantages.
Firstly, the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up. This means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time. This education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries.
In addition, it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible. Animals also have lives, and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed. This is also the same in human lives. Young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition, and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children. As a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help.
Finally, these activities, such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of, but also more educational for children firsthand, instead of watching documental TV programs. Through these activities, children will become aware of current issues, for example, food consumerism, extinction of animal species, global warming, and so on. If they learned as young as possible, the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase. As a result, our lifestyle will improve more peacefully.

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people believe that young children ought to breed animals and plant vegetables. This essay will argue about some pros and cons of children working as farmers, and also show that disadvantages overtake the benefits of it.
One the one hand, it is a fact that young children who work looking after animals and plants learn how to respect the environment and develop an elevated sense of responsability. Certainly, activities such as taking care of animals and grow vegetables favour children in many aspects of their lives, like to have a better health, mostly because of doing lots of outdoor activities and eating healthier food than city children.
On the other hand, if children learn how to work as a farmer, they could try to do it alone, without any supervision, which is surely a hard work, with a lot of difficult and responsabilties. In order words, those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live. For example, it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables, and those tools could harm easily a child. In addition, looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working.
In conclusion, although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables, the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high, because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools. In my opinion, young children should learn how to do it but they must not do those activities even if they were supervised by adults."

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, it is widely believed that education has become an important aspect of our lives, especially for primary children, which have to be well educated before achieving the period of adolescence. Furthermore, I hold on firmly to the belief that, children should learn how to respect the environment, especially the agriculture such as vegetables and the wildlife as animals.
To begin with, children should learn how to cultivate and grow vegetables, in order to respect the environment. In other words, children may experience some extra activities related to plants cultivation during or after school. For instance, educational institutions could organise some apprenticeship activities and teach how to cultivate and grow vegetables. In addition to this, it often claimed that taking part in these types of activities may develop children's skills and acquiring leadership skills. Moreover, young students could experience different types of cultivation, in order to gain knowledge of agriculture sector. Therefore, these may be useful for children's career prospects and for their future.
Secondly, another vital aspect of our world that should be considered is the wildlife, especially there some animals endangered. In other words, animals have become significant for the world's ecosystems and useful for companionship. For example, it is generally agreed that children may have to learn how to maintain animals. Additionally, children could experience activities in animals protection associations, in order to learn how to keep and protect animals with the support of some volunteers. As a result, children when they grow up are aware to the fact that animals are important and have to be always appreciated and respected.
In conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, the advantages of learning how to cultivate vegetables and keep animals definitely outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, there is no doubt that children doing these activities may gain many positive experiences, develop their skills and learn how value and appreciate the environment including wildlife."

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is proposed that elementary schools should teach their pupils vegetable growing and animal keeping skills. Although there are controversial views towards this proposal, I believe that its benefits outweigh its drawback for a range of reasons stated below.
On the one hand, experiences of vegetable growning and animals keeping can help children develop some first hand knowledge and some key characters that would benefit them in the long run. Firstly, by involving in the process of vegetables growing, children gain in-depth understanding of the nature and its impact on the development of a life cycle. In this case, they are capable of learning some practiacal knowledge regarding how weather and seasons could either foster or destruct the growth of plants. Secondly, keeping pets or other animals can encourage the deveopment of the pupils' responsibility. As they learn how to rountinely feed animals, and take showers for them, their responsbility and empathy also grow hand in hand, which would lay a solid foundation for their future study, family life and professional career.
On the other hand, it may be argued that taking such courses could distact students from their intensive study. It is not necessarily true because the aforementioned knwledge and skills can be transferble to their academic study and social life in schools. For example, their first hand experiences of growing vegetables can advance their understanding of some theoretical knowledge about plants in the bilogy class. The empathy deveoped through raising animlas could be also taken advantage to strengthen relationships with teachers and peers.
In conclusion, it is understandable that some people oppose the idea of the pupils learning vegetables growing and animals keeping, but I strongly think that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages."

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals. Although there are downsides to this proposal, the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter.
The main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment. There is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books, but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with. In addition, by learning about foods and animals, children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food. Only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food, can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike. For instance, public schools in Melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste. Hence, the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in.
However, it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked. One of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids. To elaborate, there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals' bodies, due to the fragility of children's immune systems, they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses, not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children. According to the agricultural department, there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in China, which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages.
In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of learning about animals and floras, the benefits of involving young toddlers in discovering about the environment still outweigh the downside."

It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them.

Recently, it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations. In this essay, I will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.
It is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. Thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. Furthermore, If children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. Moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. Some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. In addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. Finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.
To recapitulate, as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise, I still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. However, in order guarantee the possible advantages I have mentioned upun above, certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. This essay will elaborate a point of agreement to the above statement.
To commence with the first reason, outdoor activities are good for children's health. As children run and play with ones' friends, outdoor activities will apparently relieve the stress. Furthermore, it is scientifically proven that an exercise is beneficial for all mankind as it is recommended by the doctors and scientists. For instance, doctors encourage the patients who have non-communicable diseases, known as lifestyle illnesses, to exercise more. Thus, it will prevent children from getting illnesses.
Additionally, spending time with one's friends will definitely help a child to build a healthy relationship with others. As a child learns universal values and realizes important aspects of life, it will greatly influence the way a child will live one's life. For example, a child can learn sportsmanship while playing sports with his or her friend.
On the other hand, playing computer games can lead a child to be addicted with electronic gadgets. Addiction is one of the most risky things which may put one's life into a pit. If a computer game consists of violent or aggressive contents within it, a child may get influenced. There are a great number of reports and thesis which focus on how computer games affect the children's behaviour in a negative way.
Moreover, electrical gadgets affect one's eyesight. Nowdays, as most of people are exposed to the lights from the devices, it can be easily proven that there are more people with glasses comparing to the past. Using a computer for a short period of time is not risky, however, using a computer for a long time for certain purposes, even if it is for research work, it will affect one's eyesight badly.
To conclude, it is proven that outdoor activities are more beneficial than playing computer games. Therefore, communities, parents, and teachers ought to encourage children to do outdoor activities rather than ordering a child be sitted for a long time, the act which causes unhealthiness."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children's Development is one of the most priorities for most of the parents and they want to ensure that their children get all the needed interventions for their children's progress. Some people think that playing outside provide more benefits compared to playing computer games. As a child who experienced both, I agree that playing outside is more beneficial.
Outdoor activities give children the opportunity to show and enhance their physical, mental, and social abilities. If a child plays in the park, he tends to explore different parts of the field by running or walking, and this develops his physical health. Joining a camping could help a kid develop his problem-solving skills, making him use his basic knowledge about the activity. A kid can also meet different children on a playground, with the same wave-length as his, and this allows him develop to be sociable to others.
On the other hand, computer games also gives kids a chance to develop their mental capabilities to the point that some get addicted playing it. Another disadvantage is it does not enable children to enhance their physical development. Other computer games offer problem-solving activities, logics, and reasoning, making children to exercise their cognitive abilities. Some games overstimulate the brain, to the point that a player can get hooked and addicted to it to play long hours. In addition, most of the computer games are not physically interactive, and let the players sit during the entire game. This would not benefit children to develop their muscles.
Although computer games could benefit children mentally but it has different disadvantages that outweighs the advantage of it. Children could develop more should they spend more time outside as it provides a chance for them to exercise, explore, and socialize to different children. These reasons brought me to agree on the statement on this task."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children’s development is very essential. It can decide whether children will grow up to be a better people or not. Many people think outdoor activities are more useful for children’s development compared with playing computer games. For me, I strongly agree with this view and wil give my reasons in the essay below.
The main reason that I agree with this statement is about socializing. Everyone knows that humans are social animals. That means they cannot live alone in society, especially kids. Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing
Another reason that I hold this view is about health. As I talk in the previous paragraph, childhood is the age of not only learning something new but also trying. Outdoor activities in terms of sports such as football or basketball can help not only connect with other kids but also make them healthy. Compared with playing computer inside their room which makes them diminish and hurt their eyesight. As it can be, children will have a good physical health form outdoor activities.
In conclusion, I strongly agree that adults should support their child with outdoor activities for the purpose of socializing and good physical health."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some groups of society are having the idea that outdoor activities are vital for children to improve their mental and physical skills rather than gaming. In my opinion, I agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects. Modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development.
The reason why I believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life, and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real-life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them. For example, when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities, she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways.
In addition to that reason, outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness, on the other hand, computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits. To illustrate, children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens.
In conclusion, outdoor activities are valuable for what they give to children, not only for their personalities to be formed and developed, but also for their understanding to multiple real-life situations."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.
Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.
The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.
Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","Rules and laws are important for society to functioning well in right path, if people do whatever they want freely in regular life then it might lead society to malfunction. This essay will argue why I completely reckon that laws are entirely needed for uplifting of civilisation.
There are plethora of reasons why rules and laws have implication of lifestyles. First and foremost reason is that, crime, accidents and environment. If there are not certain rules about crime then people definitely do many criminal activities in each and every place , so other persons do not fell secure and safe. If people have freedom for whatever they want to do then , it will very dangerous for society as well as environment. Secondly, young generation could not differentiate what is right or wrong without the teaching of rules. For example, if official authorities could freely get implicated in money laundering from the national budgets and not encounter any punishment , then possible results in the political, economic and social turmoil in the country.
Moreover, if there are no traffic rules then the situation of roads will not be imagined by anyone. The drugs are legal in countries then it is mainly effect on young generation's future and they will never know about right things. Pollution is only controlled by the Government's rules. If there are no any rules then human can not imagine the pollution level in the air.
On the contrary, some people think that, rules and laws are unnecessary for their rights. If people aware about, what is good or bad for society, environment and themselves then it is not issue about laws and rules. However, many persons really can not understand about rules , so the Government made for people's peace and safety. Regulation is key that perfectly handle people's life in particular manner.
To put in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, rules and laws are essential for the functioning of society. If citizens are given freedom to do whatever they like, then they will not only fall into bad habits but also creat confusion and nuisance in society as well as nation."

Some agree that if there would be no rules, our society could not function the way it does now. This essay will argue why rules and laws are necessary for a functioning society.
Some people have such high moral standarts, that even if there would be no rules, they would act exactly as they are with rules set in place. These people are geniunely kind and would never want to cheat ir cause harm to another person. It is not the law that makes them act this way, but rather their personality and values. This is why if everyone would be like this, no laws would be necessary, because people would act humane and want only the best for eachother.
The society we live in could not exist without rules and laws set in place to control it. Everyone is different and they have a different value system and understanding of what is an acceptable action and what is not. Some people believe that it is ok to steal from another, cheat or do harm to another person. Only thing that tries to keep them in place is our system law enforcement, that promises consequences if the rules are broken. For many people this is enough to live by the rules. However, even with the laws set in place, some still break them for their own benifit. If people commit crime, knowing that they can be punished for it, how many more would do harm if there would be no consequences to their action? For these reasons our world could not run without it being regulated by the system of law.
To conclude, even though some people naturally follow rules, it is not enough for a functioning society, because many others would feel free to do what they want to. Ultimately, our society could not function as it does now, if there would be no laws and rules to follow, and the possibility of serious consequences if those are broken."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.
Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.
Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'
From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being."

Purchasing items on the web is a tending thing to put into consideration. The huge tendency to get whatever basically required from a click of a finger is blessing for many. Such facility had enabled disabled people to get access to millions of global shopping markets with their varieties. In addition, it had proven its efficiency among the massive liquidity and momentum from overseas markets and local marketing agencies, in addition to the enormous numbers of online purchasers. For instance, getting a basic need from a grocery had become much more simple than getting to step out to the next building store. The absolute advantageous effect of this trend feature will benifit this generation, and the next, which will seem unprecedented.
On the other hand, despite the fact that the pros firmly outweighs the cons; they could sound quite frankly heavy to tolerate. Many dark facts of such virtual store system must be clarified. One fact is the delivery system. Late delivery could cause catastrophic consequences. Poor shipping as well is a jeopardizing negative issue. For example, One month ago, I have personally ordered from a famous well-known store in my region. The usual shipping time was stated to be form 3 - 5 days at most. With all respect. They never respected their delivery date expected, urging me to wait a period of 30 days with no exaggeration. However, other customers could have complained to the court and asked for their right, but i was much more tolerant and patient.
A good summary suggest, that how much was this online trading circle wide , popular and efficient. There must be some dark facts and troubles that in fact, could be solved. Ultimately, I suggest that this innovation will contain the global markets dramatically, getting a long ride to a store a forgettable thing."

Nowadays, modern technology has been created to help people in several aspects of their daily lives, one of them being shopping. Some people consider that modern technology has made shopping easier, whereas, some detractors consider that these new technological gadgets have made it more difficult. I highly agree that the current technology has facilitate shopping due to the reasons explained in the following paragraphs.
On the one hand, technology has made shopping easier, because it saves people's money and time. Regarding shopping, new websites, such as, Amazon and Whish, as well as, applications, like Cornershop and Uber Eats, have enabled people to buy food, clothes and various goods from the confort of their homes. Thus, it is no longer necessary to travel to a shop, waste time in a queue and spend money in a parking ticket. This means that people can use the time that was spend in shopping on other activities (i.e., reading a book, doing sports, cooking, among others).
Moreover, technology enabled a new and varied competition in the market, making it possible that small shops, which were uknown and did not have the resources to have a physical space, now can be famous known. For instance, ""Mercado Libre"" (Free Market in English) is a website that helped several sellers make their products known to the public.
One the other hand, some detractors may indicate that technology has made shopping today more difficult, due to the lack of interpersonal relationship between the seller and the buyer. This hindrance makes it impossible to test the product before buying it. Nowadays, several people prefer staying at home and buy what they need in the internet or in an application, not being possible to have a face to face conversation with the person that it is selling a product. However, websites and applications have reviews by the consumers of the products, therefore, people can be informed of a good before it is bought.
In conclusion, modern technology may imply some complications like the lack of testing a product before buying it, however, the advantages are superior, mainly, because it has make people's lives easier, saving them time and money that could be used in other activities more enriching than going shopping."

Some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence. As far as I am concerned, shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions.
On the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay etc. The two key features of all these innovations have become, firstly, decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone, not by your cash. Because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts.
At the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods. As a consequence, customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need. At this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it. To clarify, the faster development is going on, the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it.
As for my personal opinion, I concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods. To elaborate, I have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it.
I can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable. There are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased, but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable. As for me, I am inclined to the first groop of people because I've also noticed a rised pace with that I've started to make my purchases."

However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.
One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.
Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.
Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.
In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully."

A number of people are of the opinion that it is preferable to choose an online shopping according to some modernisations in technology, while others contend that the traditional type of buying things is more effective. In this essay, I shall examine both sides before offering my own thoughts in the subject.
To begin with, buying things online can be much easier compared to conventional type of shopping due to the number of reasons. First of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online. The first reason is the fact that you can find a great amount of websites prepared for shopping. These websites have clothes, products, technics and other stuff you need. For instance, people can buy fruits and/or vegetables from other countries, so, it means that they can discover culture of people living there.
As for traditional shopping, it is time-consuming because you need to drive or go around the town looking for things you need. In fact, people who choose conventional type of shopping need a great time of preparation to go there because they need to look good, especially if they are the governor ones or even another important people in area they live.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","In recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about where it is better to shop. A number of people are of the opinion that it is preferable to choose an online shopping according to some modernisations in technology, while others contend that the traditional type of buying things is more effective. In this essay, I shall examine both sides before offering my own thoughts in the subject.
To begin with, buying things online can be much easier compared to conventional type of shopping due to the number of reasons. First of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online. The first reason is the fact that you can find a great amount of websites prepared for shopping. These websites have clothes, products, technics and other stuff you need. For instance, people can buy fruits and/or vegetables from other countries, so, it means that they can discover culture of people living there.
As for traditional shopping, it is time-consuming because you need to drive or go around the town looking for things you need. In fact, people who choose conventional type of shopping need a great time of preparation to go there because they need to look good, especially if they are the governor ones or even another important people in area they live.
In conclusion, every person has to choose his own preferable type of shopping because evryone has different opinions. Also, if there were no online shopping, people would have less things the want to buy."

Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.
First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.
Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.
To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art."

Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","Why Classical Music has not garnered the attention and recognition it deserves?.In this article we will cover all factors that have led to this question and will also provide my views on this highly debated topic.
Classical music which is considered one of the oldest forms of music. It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.
This has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.
For example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.
Classical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts. So if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music.
Howerver, with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music.
In conclusion, we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form.However, attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook."

Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.
While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.
Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.
In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents."

Humans in the world, in the present day do many paramount activities which are breathtaking, changing from hang-gliding to mountain climibing. In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness. In this essay I will ounline my opinion and provide reasons with valid examples.
On the one hand, human begins are under the pressure of globalisation, which leads them to get more trendy experiences from nature. Since younger generation is working towards the urban development of the world they are living in large cities full of pollution and high rising buildings. When ever they find enough spare time youngsters are trying to enjoy their lifes by climbing mountains which is hiking from the technical term. To contrast this gives them the opportunity to learn more about the outside world of cities, get more experience in mother nature. They develop their knowledge about the surroundings, such as the animals, birds and different flora and faunas. As an example one of my friends wanted to do the activity of flying which this is an human made activity, but after few findings through the internet and she seeing pictures how people enjoy hiking she decided to go on a trip to Mount Everest for climbing.
On the other hand, people, or the young generation have the sense that activity of flying apparatus are outdated and this is not providing then enough physical fitness to burn their calories. Due to these reasons some group of young as well as old people climb mountains to develop their well-being, mostly people such as athletes and humans who are having various diseases such as obesity, adore to do hiking.
To sum up, in my opinion this trend is not a bad idea for the poeple to get escaped from their busy lifestyles to enjoy the nature as well as develop their fitness rather than going to artificial equipment based buildings. In fact, every sport has their own risk, so people need to accept and beware of these risky issues and attend these activities."
