3774,2,"I disagree that certain material, books,movies, or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc. that are inappropiate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book. A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropiate, they should have identification to show that they are of age.

There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book, and let the child check the book or magazine out. This is where th problem begin. All libraries should identitify each child when they check-out a book, magazine, or music. that why movies are rated, so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching.",4.6,low,1.0

First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City.

15800,6,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe.",7.75,high,3.0

This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it.

If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library.

Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems.

Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility.

Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory. How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings. Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows. In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version.

Another obstacle that they faced is that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over suburban areas. The greatest obstacle is the violent air currents would make the back of the Ship swivel around the mooring mast.,7.75,high,3.0

Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.""

One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more.Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast.""The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building."" The attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building failed.",10.0,high,3.0

Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing.

Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.""
